Sumibli holds that there are two kinds of color: the wavelength of light, and the subjective experience of having human eyes. Wavelengths of light are expressed using 🔗philo_units units of measurement💬. This page is on subjective human color. That being said, we do distinguish between 🔈apparent💬 color and 🔈intrinsic💬 color. The apparent color of Luna is white, but that's because it's very bight compared to the night sky. If you look at a moon rock in a normal room, it will appear 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock grey or even brown💬. Similarly, if you wear a red shirt in a room with only blue lights, it will appear black.

The definitions of colors later on in this document will ignore the distinction and give a single definition. Just remember: left orientation = how it seems in the relevant context; right orientation = what types of light it reflects. In many cases it's fine to use either.

Sumibli takes HSV to be the correct model of the color space: 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#/media/File:HSL_color_solid_dblcone_chroma_gray.png a bicone with one tip being white, the other being black, and the half-way disk between the tips being colorful around the edge and gray in the middle💬. The colors around the equator of the bicone are divided into six sections, conceptually ordered from lowest to highest wavelength, with the last being a color that is impossible to produce with a single wavelength of photons: magenta.

|🎏glibva|glibva|gray
|🎏glibga|glibga|red ~ #F00

|🎏glibsai|glibsai|yellow ~ #FF0

|🎏glibki|glibki|green ~ #0F0

Colors can be mixed by adding successive augments to the root. For example, saying “glibkuvla” can be translated as “the magenta kind of blue” which caches out to a hue approximately half-way between magenta and blue, erring on the side of blue. “glibgava” can be seen as a desaturated red, ie brown. “glibkina” is a black-kind-of-green.

One can also simply provide color-coordinates by attaching a 🔗philo_number number💬 as an augment to “glibla”. The number framework used specifies Hue, Saturation, and Value via a string of digits with “i”, “a”, and “u” values, in that order. Again, 0 hue indicates red. The digits specify a fraction of the range in decreasing order of significance. If a digit-type is left out, that value is assumed to be at the top of the range (ie 1).

= #CCFFFF
