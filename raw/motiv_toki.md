One might wonder why Sumibli is necessary when Toki Pona already exists. Toki Pona has many of the same features, goals, and aesthetics, with the huge added benefit of already being quite popular.

The simple answer is that Toki Pona is designed around a different philosophy than Sumibli. Toki Pona believes that simpler is better to the point where complex ideas become hard to communicate. jan Sonja says in her book:
“By being so general and vague, Toki Pona often lacks the ability to distinguish finer shades of meaning. … Toki Pona has a rather narrow range of functions. Although it is very easy to meditate and communicate honest thoughts and everyday activities in Toki Pona, it is impossible to translate a chemical textbook or legal document in the language without significant losses.”

This is a deliberate choice, and I respect it. Languages don't all have to be the same kind of thing, and Toki Pona is pretty good at what it does. It does mean, however, that the language is oversimplified and insufficient for being a utopian language for the transhuman future.

A good example of the disconnect is in talking about numbers. Toki Pona, in the interest of simplicity, has words for none (0), 1, 2, 5, many (20), and all (100). Other numbers are communicated by adding smaller numbers together; 6 is 5 + 1, etc. Large, precise numbers like one hundred and twenty one million and thirty-five are essentially impossible to say in Toki Pona. Sumibli, on the other hand, is built for expressing complex thoughts, like large numbers, decimals, scientific notation, and arbitrary base schema like times and dates.

In general, the emphasis on simplicity means that to express a nuanced concept in Toki Pona is a chore. The vocabulary is too small to efficiently distinguish shades of meaning in a way that is sufficiently precise for my purposes.

📛Nitpicks

The true reason Toki Pona is insufficient is due to its super simple aesthetic. But there are a host of other issues with the language that I also take issue with.

Let's start with some that others have noticed.

While the general compositionality of Toki Pona is good, and mirrors Sumibli and Lojban, Toki Pona decided that instead of having canonical definitions for compounds, they are resolved contextually. This helps avoid dictionary bloat, but also means sometimes you say something like "moku soweli" and it means "dog food" (food for dogs) and other times it means "meat" (food from animals). I would have no objection with either of these definitions, but trying to support both seems foolish.

There's a similar ambiguity around many of the words. For example "ona li moku" can mean either "she eats" or "she's food". Similarly "mi awen" can mean "I'm safe" or "I'm staying". Simplicity does not require ambiguity, and I think something important was sacrificed in allowing words to be used as nouns/adjectives in the verb slot with an implicit to-be, without distinguishing this case from when a word is being used as a verb.

A related, and probably more egregious issue is that compounds are not distinct from other structures involving juxtaposed words. For instance, "jan pona" is a "good person" and is also a "friend"! This semantic collision is bad – sometimes I want to use adjectives without compounding. Sometimes I want to talk about someone who is definitely not my friend, but who I consider good.

Worse, this shows up with auxiliary verbs (prepositions) like "o pana e tomo tawa mi". Does this mean "give the house to me" ([o pana e tomo] tawa mi) or "give me my car" (o pana e [tomo tawa mi])? These are very different sentences!

Moving on, I am not fond of the inconsistency with "mi"/"sina" on the grammar. I understand the desire for making sentences like "mi sona" ("I know") short, but it introduces some ambiguity and complexity that would have been easy to avoid just by dropping the special-case (thus having it be "mi li sona").

The forms of the words feels very random. Why is "jo" (to hold/contain) two letters without any real consonants, while "sitelen" (image) is seven letters (three syllables!)? I don't see any underlying logic here.

In the same vein, I dislike the etymological choices. It seems like one should either commit to making the vocabulary easy for speakers of one language (eg English) or to abandon having serious etymological roots, and optimize for something else instead. Having 5% of the vocabulary come from Mandarin won't help anyone.

Perhaps the story around word structure and etymology is that jan Sonja was optimizing for making sentences sound nice. I honestly enjoy listening to Toki Pona, and that's perhaps why. Still, a perfect language would be both beautiful to the ear and logical to the mind.

As one last nitpick, I find the word "pu", which means "interacting with the official book of Toki Pona" to be an ugly choice to include in a language with only about 140 words. I think it's supposed to be a joke? If so, I think it's kinda gross. 🔗https://mw.lojban.org/papri/besto Time to besto!💬
