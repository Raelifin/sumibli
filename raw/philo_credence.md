The word “chia” can be seen as something like a full-stop that separates sentences, but it can also be seen as “I believe”. Inbuilt in this is an implication that 🔗philo_assertion the speaker could be wrong about what they’re saying💬, and is only trying to capture their local view of the world. But sometimes it is important to explicitly flag some claim as speculative. In natural language, such claims are made using words like “probably”, “perhaps”, “I think”, or “I believe”. Similarly, one can emphasize confidence by saying things like “obviously”, “certainly”, or “I’m sure that”.

Unfortunately, these natural-language expressions are extremely vague. One person’s "obviously" is another person’s "probably". Sumibli takes the stance that most of the time one shouldn’t bother communicating confidence, but when you do communicate confidence it should be in a clear and precise way.

To do this, we adopt an explicitly Bayesian approach of seeing confidence in a belief as essentially credence in a probabilistic proposition. Credence is measured in terms of what gambles that depend on that proposition the person would accept, which in turn can be cached out to a probability (if that person is VNM rational).

Thus, instead of saying something like “it’s probably going to rain today”, a Sumibli speaker would say something like “I’d take a bet at 4:1 odds against me that it’s going to rain today”. Warning: this statement should not be interpreted as “I have 80% credence on it raining today”, but rather as something more like “I have a 📣more💬 than 80% credence on it raining, such that a 4:1 bet would strike me as a good opportunity”.

We see these sorts of bets as the basis of probabilistic thinking, and the most natural way to talk about probabilities. But sometimes it's useful to talk about probabilities directly, and think about the inflection point where a bet around a given proposition has zero expected value. When working with these probabilities we still think in terms of odds, where higher numbers indicate higher likelihood.

To express that something is certain, we either say it is true or that it is tautological. To express that something is impossible, we either say it is false, or that it is a contradiction. There is no way to bet around such things, for the obvious reason.
