Sumibli is designed to work in a variety of places, including other planets, space-stations, and simulations. That being said, the dynamics and properties of air and water are fairly universal, so the taxonomy of weather is probably about what you expect.

|🎏ta|ta|sky|weather
|🎏tati|tati|clear sky|calm weather
|🎏kuta|kuta|steam|humid
|🎏taku|taku|cloud|cloudy
|🎏takudu|takudu|fog|foggy
|🎏tanau|tanau|cold air|cold weather
|🎏taga|taga|hot air|hot weather
|🎏takuni|takuni|(precipitating)
storm|precipitation
|🎏takukni|takukni|rainstorm|rain
|🎏tankuni|tankuni|snowstorm|snow
|🎏tankukni|tankukni|sleetstorm|sleet
|🎏tankunida|tankunida|hailstorm|hail
|🎏targi|targi|wind|windy
|🎏targai|targai|windstorm|very windy

One unique thing about the Sumibli weather terms is that "precipitation" is a pretty common word, compared to "rain"/"snow"/etc. It's not uncommon for an English translation of "takuni" to simply be "rain", even though it's more vague than that.

|🎏takuni|takuni|It's raining.
|🎏ima la pi lur takuni|ima la pi lur takuni|I like rain.
