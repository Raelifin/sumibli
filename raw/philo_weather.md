📛Weather

Sumibli is designed to work in a variety of places, including other planets, space-stations, and simulations. That being said, the dynamics and properties of air and water are fairly universal, so the taxonomy of weather is probably about what you expect.

|🎏ta|ta|sky|weather
|🎏tati|tati|clear sky|calm weather
|🎏kuta|kuta|steam|humid
|🎏taku|taku|cloud|cloudy
|🎏takudu|takudu|fog|foggy
|🎏tanau|tanau|cold air|cold weather
|🎏taga|taga|hot air|hot weather
|🎏takuni|takuni|(precipitating)
storm|precipitation
|🎏takukni|takukni|rainstorm|rain
|🎏tankuni|tankuni|snowstorm|snow
|🎏tankukni|tankukni|sleetstorm|sleet
|🎏tankunida|tankunida|hailstorm|hail
|🎏targi|targi|wind|windy
|🎏targai|targai|windstorm|very windy

One unique thing about the Sumibli weather terms is that "precipitation" is a pretty common word, compared to "rain"/"snow"/etc. It's not uncommon for an English translation of "takuni" to simply be "rain", even though it's more vague than that.

|🎏takuni|takuni|It's raining.
|🎏ima la pi lur takuni|ima la pi lur takuni|I like rain.

📛Seasons

Sumibli philosophy puts forth that there are two primary seasons, which can roughly be translated into "spring/summer" and "autumn/winter". The peak of the warm season is when the days are longest, and the heart of the cold season is when days are shortest. These primary seasons can be subdivided into early/late halves.

|🎏klata|klata|year|annual
|🎏klatata|klatata|season|seasonal
|🎏klatatga|klatatga|spring/summer|vernal/estival
|🎏klatatna|klatatna|autumn/winter|autumnal/brumal
|🎏klatatgatu|klatatgatu|spring|summer
|🎏klatatnatu|klatatnatu|autumn|winter

As with weather, it's more common to talk about the primary seasons than their early/late parts. Often the right translation of "klatatga" is just "summer", for instance.

Sumibli Earth culture divides the calendar into 360 normal days with either 5 or 6 holidays ("strange days"). Each season is 180 days and can be divided into six months of 30 days each. (See 🔗philo_days Days, Times, and Weeks💬 for more.) The start of the year is on the vernal equinox, and has two holidays. The solstices each have one holiday, and the autumnal equinox has either one or two holidays depending on if it's a leap-year.
