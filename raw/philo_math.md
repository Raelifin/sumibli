Prerequisite: 🔗philo_number Sumibli numbers💬

Mathematical expressions can be spoken in Sumibli as normal sentences. The notation of mathematics is still important, and it's rare to write out something like "twenty-two plus five" when "22 + 5" exists as an option, but Sumibli provides a way of expressing formulae verbally. No order-of-operations is needed, as the sub-expressions are necessarily parenthesized by the grammar.

|🎏isiba|isiba|1
|🎏isita|isita|2
|🎏isiba la sita|isiba la sita|1 × 2
|🎏ili siba li sita|ili siba li sita|1 + 2
|🎏ilish li siba li sita
lash la sita|ilish li siba li sita
lash la sita|(1 + 2) × 2

The downside of having parentheses as part of the grammar is that things can become a mouthful. It's recommended to read over that last sentence in pieces:

|ilish|(
|li siba|+ 1
|li sita|+ 2
|lash|)
|la sita|× 2

In breaking it down we can see how the mouthful has a simple one-to-one correspondence with the math.

As we can see, in a sentence/clause where there are two numbers as subjects and no verb, we add the numbers together. The implied operator here depends on the type of the nouns in the sentence, but it's always from a commutative semigroup.

When a sentence has no verb, but it has both a subject and an object, we think of the implied verb being "equals". This is uncommon in most Sumibli, but is very common in mathematical expressions.

|🎏ili siba li sita
lu sida|ili siba li sita
lu sida|1 + 2 = 3

There is also a word which expresses equality directly:

|🎏sau|sau|equal/isomorphic|equivalence/isomorphism

But as we can see, this relates a set of things to an equivalence relation that applies to all of them. In most circumstances the leave-the-verb-out syntax for equality is cleaner.

To talk about things being unequal, one can either negate "sau" or say that an equality is false.

|🎏za|za|truth|evidence/proof
|🎏zana|zana|falsehood|counter-evidence
|🎏sauna|sauna|unequal|equivalence relation

|🎏ilish li siba li sita lu siga lash la zana|ilish li siba li sita lu siga lash la zana|1 + 2 ≠ 5

To talk about variables/constants, we simply use pronouns. Different pronouns imply different things about the quantity. (But of course, these associations aren't a restriction on the grammar, and any pronoun can be used to meet the author's need, even if it's non-standard.)

|🎏thip|thip|primary generic variable (x)
|🎏thub|thub|primary generic constant (a)
|🎏thit|thit|secondary generic variable (y)
|🎏thud|thud|secondary generic constant (b)
|🎏thik|thik|teritary generic variable (z)
|🎏thug|thug|tertiary generic constant (c)

|🎏thup|thup|alternate primary generic variable (x')
|🎏thib|thib|alternate primary generic constant (a')
|🎏thut|thut|alternate secondary generic variable (y')
|🎏thid|thid|alternate secondary generic constant (b')

|🎏thif|thif|primary generic function (f)
|🎏thuf|thuf|alternate primary generic function (f')
|🎏thuv|thuv|secondary generic function (g)
|🎏thiv|thiv|alternate secondary generic function (g')
|🎏this|this|tertiary generic function (h)

|🎏thaup|thaup|unknown angle (θ)
|🎏thaub|thaub|unknown radius (r)
|🎏thiup|thiup|primary unknown vector (v)
|🎏thiut|thiut|secondary unknown vector (u)
|🎏thaib|thaib|unknown length (l)
|🎏thait|thait|unknown area (a)
|🎏thaid|thaid|unknown volume (v)
|🎏thuit|thuit|unknown time (t)
|🎏thuap|thuap|unknown distribution (P)
|🎏thum|thum|generic binary operator (+)
|🎏thin|thin|generic inverse binary operator (-)
|🎏thiz|thiz|unknown proposition (P)

|🎏thaut|thaut|circle constant (τ; circumference/radius)
|🎏thuil|thuil|exponential constant (e; Σₙ 1/n!)
|🎏thil|thil|exponential function (exp(x); eˣ)
|🎏thur|thur|natural log function (log(x); ln(x))
|🎏thaif|thaif|golden ratio (ϕ; (1 + √5)/2)

Of course, each domain of science also has its own preferences for which pronouns are used for which variables/constants.

We can efficiently juxtapose variables (or other terms) by using "shu". In most contexts, juxtaposition is implied to be multiplication.

|🎏ili thip shu sita lu sipa|ili thip shu sita lu sipa|2x = 0
|🎏li thip shu thit lu thik|li thip shu thit lu thik|xy = z

Function application can be done using "sha", where we see the input to the function as the owner. (The idea here is that the function is a set of outputs, and we can ask for x's output.)

|🎏li thif shu thip lu thuit|li thif shu thip lu thuit|f(x) = t
