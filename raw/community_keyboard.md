One of the core 🔗\🚀 desiderata💬 for Sumibli is "typability". Sumibli is designed to be written using a keyboard, for example by using symbols that are easy to distinguish, but not necessarily easy to write with a pen.

This was actually one of the core reasons that I created Sumibli – I found myself wanting a keyboard setup that was faster and better than the norm. Stenography is the obviously superior alternative to the common keyboard setup. People fight online about whether Dvorak or Qwerty are better keyboard layouts, but the sad truth is that it 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout#Research_on_efficiency doesn't matter much💬. Stenography, on the other hand, is 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype obviously faster💬.

But in switching to a stenotype machine, I found myself wishing for something principled. The usual stenographic shorthand is English-centric and artibrary, focusing on non-standard hardware. Using Sumibli, I claim that one can get to speed-of-speech rate with standard hardware and an easy learning curve.

Here's how it works:

Get a keyboard with n-key rollover, three rows for the fingers, and at least one (distinct) button per thumb (preferably more; the absence of thumb-buttons on a usual keyboard is insane). I recommend the 🔗https://ergodox-ez.com/ Ergodox EZ💬.

Pairs of fingers are grouped from left-to-right. So the left pinky and ring fingers form a pair, then the left middle and index fingers, then the right index and middle, then the right ring and pinky fingers. Fingers travel up and down in their column, but never side-to-side. Thus each finger can hit one of three keys (home/bot/top row) or not hit any key, giving a total of 4² = 16 possible inputs for a pair of fingers.

The first and third pair of fingers (left pinky+ring, and right index+middle) are responsible for most consonants, and the other fingers are responsible for vowels. When keys are pressed, the letters line up in the same orientation as the fingers.

For example, in the key-mapping that I'm about to provide, pressing the home row keys for both fingers gives "b" for consonant fingers and "la" for vowel fingers. Thus pressing all the fingers down in the natural resting place produces "blabla". That's why I call this key-mapping the "blabla" key mapping.

|First Finger|Second Finger|Consonant
|-|-|
|-|Home|sh
|-|Bot|th
|-|Top|r
|Home|-|p
|Home|Home|b
|Home|Bot|t
|Home|Top|d
|Bot|-|k
|Bot|Home|g
|Bot|Bot|n
|Bot|Top|m
|Top|-|f
|Top|Home|v
|Top|Bot|s
|Top|Top|z

The logic for consonants is pretty simple. The standard consonants are in order, with the odd consonants filling out the only-second-finger-down weird-space.

|First Finger|Second Finger|Vowel (etc)
|-|-|
|-|Home|l
|-|Bot|h
|-|Top|r
|Home|-|a
|Home|Home|la
|Home|Bot|ai
|Home|Top|au
|Bot|-|i
|Bot|Home|ia
|Bot|Bot|li
|Bot|Top|iu
|Top|-|u
|Top|Home|ua
|Top|Bot|ui
|Top|Top|lu

The logic for the vowels is also pretty simple. The home row is for "a", the row closer to the typist is for "i", and the row further away is for "u". Hitting the same row twice prouces "l_", and only-second-finger-down produces weird consonants that aren't typical to produce by themselves in Sumibli.

As a special rule, if the right hand produces a vowel and no consonant, then the vowel is preceded by "h".

Lifting any finger freezes the letters that have already been input and begins a new letter sequence. Whitespace and other symbols/modifiers can be entered by the thumbs.
