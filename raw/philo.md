Sumibli isn't just a language – it's also a paradigm.

As an example, Sumibli doesn't enforce a notion of gender. Speakers can specify gender, but it's not forced by the grammar/vocabulary. This change helps to avoid anthropomorphizing objects compared to languages like Spanish, but it also is aligned with a future world where personhood has trancended the evolved context and baggage like gender.

In many ways, Sumibli is 📣utopian💬. The philosophy proposed in these pages is less about a pragmatic way of engaging with the modern world, and more about having a 🔈target💬 of how the ideal society thinks.
