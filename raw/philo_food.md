The expressions for "eat", "consumer", and "food/drink" all come from "bikda", which traces its etymology to to-take-stuff-as-an-animal.

|🎏bikda|bikda|consumer/eater|food/drink/fuel

Words for describing diets all have "bikda" as the stem, with the diet being the right meaning and the consumer being the left meaning.

|🎏bikdarkai|bikdarkai|carnivore|meat
|🎏bikdakdau|bikdakdau|herbivore/vegitarian|vegetable
|🎏bikdatai|bikdatai|omnivore|challenging food
|🎏bikdarku|bikdarku|drinker|drink/liquid
|🎏bikdarsh kaiku|bikdarsh kaiku|pescetarian|fish meat
|🎏bikdarsh kaigvidu|bikdarsh kaigvidu|cow-eater|beef
|🎏bikdarsh kaidvi|bikdarsh kaidvi|pig-eater|pork
|🎏bikdanarsh kaidvi|bikdanarsh
kaidvi|non-pig-eater|food without pork

As we can see, "bikdarsh" can be put before a word for a specific kind of animal to talk about someone who eats that specific kind of animal, as well as talk about meat from that animal.

It is more typical, however, to simply talk about the relevant animal/plant, and understand that it's food through context. Here are a few words that might be useful when talking about food.
