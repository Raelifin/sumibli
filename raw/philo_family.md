Sumibli puts far less emphasis on 🔗philo_gender gender💬 than most languages. As such, the words for family are all gender-neutral by default, but can be augmented with gender if desired.

The most primal notion of family is that of parents and children. Sumibli distinguishes biological parentage from developmental parentage. Neither relation is given more weight or considered the more "true" version of parenting. People who adopt are parents, and sperm donors are parents, albeit in completely different ways. Sumibli makes this distinction clear. It is encouraged not to cleave too tightly to this dichotomy, as each person's situation is unique and edge-cases definitely exist. When both words apply, it's common to simply use the word that doesn't require flipping orientation.

Remember, Sumibli is meant to augument, rather than replace, natural language. It's encouraged for children to have special names for their parents like "ma" or "papa" that aren't in Sumibli. These names would then be included in Sumibli as any other foreign word/name.

Children who share a parent, either biologically or developmentally, are siblings. As before, Sumibli distinguishes between biological and developmental siblings. When both apply it is suggested that (as with parents) one choose the word that gives the right connotation, or simply choose the one that has the right orientation. The number of shared parents is not implied by the words for sibling. If one wishes to specify the portion of parents shared, one can augment with a 🔗philo_number fractional number💬 or "sla" for "all".

|🎏sauvai|sauvai|sibling
(developmental)|shared guardian
|🎏saurfash sidi|saurfash sidi|half-sibling|shared parent
|🎏saurfasla|saurfasla|full-sibling|shared parent(s)

Grandparents and grandchildren are specified by tacking on a prefix to the start of a word. Each additional generation is another prefix.

|🎏fafaki|fafaki|grandparent

|🎏vaivairtu|vaivairtu|grandchild
(developmental)|grandparent

|🎏farvairtu|farvairtu|the biological parent

We can similarly augment compounds to express more distant relations.

|🎏saurfafa|saurfafa|cousin|shared grandparent
|🎏vairtush saurfafa|vairtush saurfafa|cousin's child
(possibly adopted)|parent's cousin

Of course, at a certain point it makes sense to talk about family more generically. Biological family has its own word, as does biological ancestry/descendency, but there is no specific word for developmental family. Instead, it is normal to talk about "developmental family" as one's tightest community (or the tightest community of one's youth). In this way there is no divide between developmental parents/siblings and, say, a best-friend who one spends lots of time with as a child. As one ages, this tight-community will naturally shift, change, and grow to include lovers, new companions, and perhaps children.

Marriage is not a monolithic concept. There are rituals for entering into one's vartau, as well as deciding to have a child together. But perhaps the most marraige-equivalent concept in Sumibli is that of promising devotion to someone else. To promise devotion is to publically swear to serve the intrests of the other at least as centrally as one serves the self, and not to abandon the other, even if the world turns against them. This kind of devotion does not explicitly state that a person cannot become simultaneously devoted to another, but the obvious conflict between being devoted to two people mean this is rare. The biggest difference between this kind of devotion and marraige is that it is not necessarily symmetric, nor does it imply a romantic relationship. A knight might swear devotion to a king, for instance.
