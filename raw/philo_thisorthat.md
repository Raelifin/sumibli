The words "this", "that", "here", and "there" are used frequently in English because it's inconvienent to spell out the subject of discussion each time one wants to reference it, and it's often clear what's being referenced from context, such as body language. Sumibli has fewer instances of words like these for a few reasons, but the most prominent of which is heavy use of distinct pronouns. Nonetheless, there are words in Sumibli that can be used as generic markers for things/places when the context is all that's needed.

|🎏tau|tau|here/now/this/closer|there/then/that/further
|🎏da|da|thing|substance
|🎏bu|bu|place|thing at a place
|🎏bau|bau|time|duration

The word "tau" is the most common way of talking about nearby things, and can be translated as "this", "that", "here", or "there", depending on context.

When we ask a non-yes/no question in Sumibli, we use the attitudinal "hau" to indicate where we want the answerer to clarify things.

|🎏ibi la pi lu hau|ibi la pi lu hau|what do you want?

But sometimes we want to offer the answerer options for things that they could say, such as "do you want this or that?". The general rule for this is that when multiple phrases are given for the same slot (eg subject/verb/object), if there is a solitary phrase that just consists of "hau", we treat each of the given phrases as options for answering. This is in contrast to the general rule which treats multiple phrases as linked by "and"; when "hau" is involved we see them as being linked by "or".

|🎏ibi la pi lu hau
lu tau lur tau|ibi la pi lu hau
lu tau lur tau|do you want
this or that?

Notice that we say "lu hau" by itself, and don't need to keep saying "hau" next to each option.

This sort of disjunction can be exclusive (only one may be picked) or inclusive (pick all if you want) depending on context. To explicitly mark it as exclusive, use "haubsi", and to mark it as inclusive use "haubsla".

If one wishes to talk about disjunction outside the context of a question, one can use the word "zau".

|🎏zau|zau|possibility/option|condition

A sentence/clause that has "zau" as the verb will treat each of its subjects as options in either an exclusive or inclusive disjuction. Again, this is ambiguous. To specify, we can use the compounds "zaubsi" and "zaubsla". The word "zauna" means the truth is none of the options.

|🎏zaubsi|zaubsi|exclusive possibility|condition
|🎏zaubsla|zaubsla|inclusive possibility|condition
|🎏zauna|zauna|anti-possibility|condition

To form a disjunction in most sentences, we use the multiple-phrases structure, as before, but put "izau" (or a compound starting with "izau") as one of the phrases.

|🎏tau la zaubsi lir tau|tau la zaubsi lir tau|either this or that
(but not both)
|🎏ibi la pi lu zau
lu tau lur tau|ibi la pi lu zau
lu tau lur tau|You want either
this or that.
