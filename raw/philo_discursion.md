📛Parentheticals

Sometimes in the course of communication it's useful to be able to stray a bit from speaking directly to the topic at hand. The simplest of these methods is the discursive parenthetical (eg this), which allows a Sumibli speaker to make a small note that otherwise wouldn't fit into the structure of an expression.

The marker for a parenthetical is "halth" – a mash-up of two basic structures: the attitudinal and the "-th" suffix. We think of attitudinals as being discursive notes about the emotional/mental state of the speaker, and the "-th" suffix as being how we capture text that otherwise doesn't fit, including things like quotations. Thus "halth" opens an arbitrarily-sized expression, that could be a sentence-fragment or even a whole paragraph, before dropping back down into the main text again. The contents of the parenthetical may be about the primary subject, or may be a meta-note about the speaker, but should always be skippable without changing the meaning of the base expression.

It is technically allowed to close a parenthetical with a pause/space (like foreign speech), but it is encouraged to flag the end of it by "tsh" (like a quote), especially if it's a long parenthetical or ambiguity would result from merely continuing.

|🎏ipa la tai lu bapdau
halth \"ma la puna lu bu tsh\"
laibau sibavavata|he got out of prison
(I don't know where)
in 1992

If one wants a parenthetical to be entirely foreign text, this is allowed. In these cases it is incorrect to end the parenthetical with "tsh".

📛Meta Confusion

Another common moment when it's useful to pop-out of commenting on the subject matter directly is when has a question about the conversation, such as when one didn't hear what the other person said.

Consider this exchange in English:
A: "The baby had something."
B: "What?"

It's not clear from the above whether B understood what A said, and was asking a question about what the baby had, or whether B simply failed to hear A. This kind of ambiguity is non-Sumiblian, and thus we have a distinct way to express that one doesn't understand.

When a sentence starts with "tshau" it expresses a break from the object-level, and implies a question (much like the more common "tshua"). It is common to simply say "tshau" as an interjection that means "huh?" or "I don't understand".

|🎏ipanunu la fu|the baby had something
|🎏tshau hau la fu|what had something?

It's not at all required that one use "tshau" instead of "tshua" when expressing confusion, like in the example above. The word "tshau" merely gives another tool to the advanced Sumibli speaker. This tool can also be used to make suggestions or comments on the meta level, with an implication that the words should not be taken as a bid to change the topic.

|🎏itshau mu la gu lur tau|should we go over there?

Not all meta-communication should involve "tshau"! Often in a conversation it is useful to 🔈change the topic💬 to the conversation itself. These kinds of going-meta are done using the standard ways of talking about things. The word "tshau" should be reserved for helping a conversation on a topic be smooth and clear, without redirecting focus.
