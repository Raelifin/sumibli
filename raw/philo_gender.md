Earth animals, and most known macroscopic life forms, are sexual in nature. Instead of simply replicating, they find a similar organism and mix genetic material to create children.

When genetic material is mixed, it is more efficient if one organism specializes in donation of genes, while the other specializes in reception of genes. This specialization between giving/receiving is the basis of sexual dimorphism – the biological difference between males and females. In Sumibli we use the analogy of communication to talk about this giving/receiving because that's what's happening; genetic information is communicated during sex.

Historically, human societies have been hugely influenced by sexual dimorphism. Female mammals (such as humans) have a much higher biological investment in babies than males (needing to cary them in a womb and then nurse them), especially in species with long pregnancies and infancies, like humans. This biological specialization was compounded by cultural/social specialization that led to things like males more commonly participating in dangerous activities like hunting and war, while females spent more time taking care of children. The cultural practice of sorting people based on sex into groups with different roles is the origin of gender – the socially constructed analog of sexual categorization.

Ancient languages, thus, are deeply rooted in gender. Many languages, for example, gender all nouns, even those that are inanimate, and have no association with sexuality at all. But gender is, in at least a significant sense, a historical notion. Thanks to technology, the limitations of biology on society and individuals are fewer day-by-day. The future is full of people who can do whatever they want, and be however they feel like being.

Sumibli, then, chooses not to place any special emphasis on gender. There are no gender words in Sumibli - only the words about sex used above. The concept of a "female person" is no more basic than "artistic person", and speakers are encouraged only to reference sex when it's actually relevant. If it's important to talk about gender, rather than sex, the "-th" suffix to import foreign words is encouraged.

The same goes for words about 🔈sexuality💬 – the expression of the sex drive in things like romance and attraction. There are no Sumibli words for things like "straight", "gay", "heterosexual", et cetera because these words have many gender implications, rather than simply being about biological sex. If needed, they can be imported with "-th". However, there is a word for talking about desire: "pi".

We can compound "pikui" with all kinds of words to talk about being sexually attracted to specific sexual traits, or to not specifically-sexual traits such as height, intelligence, health, et cetera.

|🎏pikuifau|pikuifau|timophile|sexy wealth

Note that these are not sexual orientations. Someone who is attracted to masculinity (ipikuima) is not necessarily exclusively attracted to masculinity.
