Sumibli doesn't have the same kind of focus on time as English or other European languages. Verbs can be set in the past, present, future, or any combination thereof without conjugations or other additions. This is because in most cases timing can be inferred from context, and in other points it's useful to be vague.

When it's important to be specific and un-vague, there are several different constructs that allow for the speaker to specify timing.

📛Augmenting

The simplest way to specify time is by augmentation. The seed words that are most often used for this are "tu" and "tau".

|🎏tu|tu|older|newer
|🎏tau|tau|now|then
|🎏gu|gu|traveler|destination

|🎏ima la gu|ima la gu|I go
(vague tense)
|🎏ima la gutu|ima la gutu|I went
|🎏ima la gurtu|ima la gurtu|I will go
|🎏ima la gutau|ima la gutau|I am going
|🎏ima la gurtau|ima la gurtau|I {went/will go}

As we can see, these suffixes provide a way of providing a tense for most verbs. The "rtau" tense is not one that English has, and corresponds to times-other-than-now. Sumibli has no structures that correspond to past/future perfect/continuous/perfect+continuous tenses.

When talking about the present, sometimes it's important to communicate continuous action. To do this, we can double-agument a verb with both "tu" and "tau".

|🎏ima la gutautu|ima la gutautu|I have been going
|🎏ima la gutaurtu|ima la gutaurtu|I am going,
and will keep going

There's a symmetric structure for continuous action made by inverting "tau".

|🎏ima la gurtautu|ima la gurtautu|I will go
(but not right now)
|🎏ima la gurtaurtu|ima la gurtaurtu|I used to go
(but not any more)

Note that the "r" in front of the "tau" naturally flips the orientation of "tu".

We can also flip the order of "tu" and "tau" to get more temporal augments.

|🎏ima la gututau|ima la gututau|I rencently went
|🎏ima la gurtutau|ima la gurtutau|I'll go in a while
|🎏ima la guturtau|ima la guturtau|I went a while ago
|🎏ima la gurturtau|ima la gurturtau|I'll go soon

📛Association

When we want to connect an action to a specific time, we often lean on "sha" to indicate association with that specific time.

|🎏ima la gu sha klaga|ima la gu sha klaga|I go today
|🎏ima la gu sha klagatu|ima la gu sha klagatu|I went yesterday
|🎏ima la gu sha klagartu|ima la gu sha klagartu|I will go tomorrow

We can sometimes use augmentation for the same effect, but often this will introduce an ambiguity.

|🎏ima la gush klaga|ima la gush klaga|I travel by day
|🎏ima la gursh klaga|ima la gursh klaga|I travel daily

📛Timeboxing

The word "bau" relates a time 🔈period💬 to one or more temporal markers, which are often seen as moments or events. This is the same kind of relationship as "ba" or "bu", but where "ba" relates a place to its edge, and "bu" relates a place to something in it, "bau" relates a time period to either the boundary of that time period 🔈or💬 an event that is in that time period. This dual-use can make things confusing, but the key heuristic is that the right is specific and sharp, while the left is loose.

|🎏bau|bau|period|event/window

The most common use of "bau" is as a preposition: "laibau". This allows us to add time as an afterthought, and to do so in an unambiguous way (compared to some of the above methods). When in left-mode ("ilaibau") this construction means something like "at the same time as" or "for the duration of", depending on what's provided next.

|🎏ima la gu
laibau mi sha bi|ima la gu
laibau mi sha bi|I go at
your signal
|🎏ima la gu
laibauth _5 min_|ima la gu
laibauth 🔈5 min💬|I'll go
for 5 min
|🎏ima la gu
la faglagi
laibau|ima la gu
la faglagi
laibau|I'll run
and yell
simultaneously

One can also use the advanced structure "laibaush" to quickly attach an entire clause as the specific time when an action occurs.

|🎏ima la gu
laibaush bi la fa
lur fagla|ima la gu
laibaush bi la fa
lur fagla|I go when
you make noise

Of course, "laibau" can also be used in right-mode. This allows for specifying the general time during which something happens, without pinning down the specific moment or implying the action takes the entire period.

|🎏ima la gur
laibau klaga|ima la gur
laibau klaga|I'll go some time today
