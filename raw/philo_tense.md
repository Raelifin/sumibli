Sumibli doesn't have the same kind of focus on time as English or other European languages. Verbs can be set in the past, present, future, or any combination thereof without conjugations or other additions. This is because in most cases timing can be inferred from context, and in other points it's useful to be vague.

When it's important to be specific and un-vague, there are several different constructs that allow for the speaker to specify timing.

📛Augmenting

The simplest way to specify time is by augmentation. The seed words that are most often used for this are "tu" and "tau".

|🎏tu|tu|older|newer
|🎏tau|tau|now|then
|🎏gu|gu|traveler|destination

|🎏ima la gu|ima la gu|I go
(vague tense)
|🎏ima la gutu|ima la gutu|I went
|🎏ima la gurtu|ima la gurtu|I will go
|🎏ima la gutau|ima la gutau|I am going
|🎏ima la gurtau|ima la gurtau|I {went/will go}

As we can see, these suffixes provide a way of providing a tense for most verbs. The "rtau" tense is not one that English has, and corresponds to times-other-than-now. Sumibli has no structures that correspond to past/future perfect/continuous/perfect+continuous tenses.

When talking about the present, sometimes it's important to communicate continuous action. To do this, we can double-agument a verb with both "tu" and "tau".

|🎏ima la gutautu|ima la gutautu|I have been going
|🎏ima la gutaurtu|ima la gutaurtu|I am going,
and will keep going

There's a symmetric structure for continuous action made by inverting "tau".

|🎏ima la gurtautu|ima la gurtautu|I will go
(but not right now)
|🎏ima la gurtaurtu|ima la gurtaurtu|I used to go
(but not any more)

Note that the "r" in front of the "tau" naturally flips the orientation of "tu".

We can also flip the order of "tu" and "tau" to get more temporal augments.

|🎏ima la gututau|ima la gututau|I rencently went
|🎏ima la gurtutau|ima la gurtutau|I'll go in a while
|🎏ima la guturtau|ima la guturtau|I went a while ago
|🎏ima la gurturtau|ima la gurturtau|I'll go soon

📛Association

When we want to connect an action to a specific time, we often lean on "sha" to indicate association with that specific time.

|🎏ima la gu sha klaga|ima la gu sha klaga|I go today
|🎏ima la gu sha klagatu|ima la gu sha klagatu|I went yesterday
|🎏ima la gu sha klagartu|ima la gu sha klagartu|I will go tomorrow

We can sometimes use augmentation for the same effect, but often this will introduce an ambiguity.

|🎏ima la gush klaga|ima la gush klaga|I travel by day
|🎏ima la gursh klaga|ima la gursh klaga|I travel daily

📛laibau

To add time as an afterthought, or to more explicitly mark a time (compared to the above methods), one can use "laibau" when in left-mode. This treats the sentence as an event with a finite duration and the phrase that comes after "laibau" is the time at which that event takes place.

|🎏bau|bau|time|event/duration

|🎏ima la gu
laibau mi sha bi|ima la gu
laibau mi sha bi|I go at
your signal

One can also use the advanced structure "laibaush" to quickly attach an entire clause as the time when an action occurs.

|🎏ima la gu
laibaush bi la fa
lur fagla|ima la gu
laibaush bi la fa
lur fagla|I go when
you make noise

Of course, "laibau" can also be used in right-mode. This allows for specifying the duration of an action.

|🎏ima la gur
laibauth _5 min_|ima la gur
laibauth 🔈5 min💬|I go
for 5 min
