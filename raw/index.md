Language is one of the most powerful technologies in the world. It's because of language that we can easily learn from others, and pass on what we've learned through the generations. It's such a core technology to our species that most probably have never thought about it as such!

And yet, existing languages are flawed. They're good for some kinds of expressions, such as poetry, but are terrible for clear, efficient, and formal communication. As we move into the future we ought to have a language that was designed for the world of tomorrow, instead of being shackled to a yesterday that was thousands of years ago.

📣Sumibli is an attempt at a utopian language.💬 It is a single, but important piece of an effort to build a future that is perfect in every possible way.
