Prerequisite: 🔗philo_number Sumibli numbers💬

The best choice of units are simultaneously those that are objective/easy to derive from first principles and which are useful at the scale that we work. Conveniently, if it turns out a unit is to big/too small for what we want to do we can rescale it by some obvious number and get a new unit that works well.

The correct choice of base-units, that can then be scaled, is should therefore be determined by the most universal of physical properties. If we meet aliens we should be surprised if they have a unit of length based on the human body, and unsurprised if their unit of length is based on the speed of light.

There are choices of physical constants based on particles like the electron, but the choice of one particle over the other is arbitrary. More universal are the 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units Planck units💬, which are based entirely on properties of physics that don't depend on specific particles.

From these five constants we can build a notion of all dimensions that we care about.

Unfortunately, this choice of units limits one's precision to the degree that these universal values are known. If you're unlucky enough to live in a time/place where the gravitational constant can't be measured to more than five or six decimal places, you may want to fall back on foreign notions of distance, time, et cetera.

To state a measurement, first state the number, then associate the number with a unit using "shu".

📛Length

To get to useful units we start by defining a reference Planck-length ("ukaba") by combining our base constants:

kaba = √(kakla × kadu ÷ kagi³) ≈ 5.729475(64)×10^−35 meters

(Note that this is √(2τ) larger than the standard Planck-length because we rationalized kadu.)

This Planck-length is too small to be of much use to a human outside. To get it to a sensible size, we multiply it by 6^42. This standard length is called "kasba".

kasba = kaba × 6^42 ≈ 5.729475(64)×10^−35 m × 4.812298×10^32 = 5.909624(66)×10^−7 m ≈ 2.757 centimeters or 1.1 inches

Since Sumibli easily lets us use scientific notation, we don't bother with larger/smaller units of distance, instead relying on powers of six. That said, it is common to express lengths by specifying "bu", "tu", or "nu" as the scientific notation component, then giving the rest of the length in normal digits.

(Fun fact, the closest the moon gets to the earth is approximately sizupapaba shu kasba!)

📛Time

Planck-time ("ukabau") is obtained by dividing our Planck-length by the speed of light. In other words it's the time it takes light to travel one ukaba. (Again, this is slightly larger than the standard Planck-time.)

kabau = kaba ÷ kagi ≈ 1.911147(36)×10^-43 seconds

To get a useful unit, we multiply by 6^54 to get a unit that's almost exactly a fifth of a second.

kasbau = kabau × 6^54 ≈ 0.200199s

Common powers for kasbau are "ku", "nu", and "zu". It is commonly understood that a normal human day consists of about sinuna shu kasbau (awake), and that an early 21st century lifespan averages sizupapaba shu kasbau (ie 36 sizu shu kasbau ≈ 83 years). It is common to talk about long lengths of time in 🔗philo_days units of days💬.

📛Mass

As above, we get a Planck-mass ("ukada") by combining other units.

kada = √(kakla × kagi ÷ kadu) ≈ 6.139607×10^−9 kg

This is already a somewhat sensible size, but to get it up further we again come up with a scaling factor, though this time only 6^6.

kasda = kada × 6^6 ≈ 0.2864495 grams

Common powers for kasda are "gu" and "mu".

|🎏kagnau|kagnau|temperature|Planck-Temperature/kagai ÷ kanau

One kagai is about half a billion Joules, so we traditionally shrink to a "kasgai" of 6^-6 times that much, which is about 2.8 kilocalories, or about the nutritional calories in one kasda of butter. Some physics settings will redefine "kasgai" to a different point that is more convenient to the sorts of problems they're addressing.

One kagnau is 7.618e31 Kelvin, which is an insanely high temperature. We thus always scale down by 6^-42 and get the "kasnau", with a value of about 0.1583 K, or about a quarter of a degree Fahrenheit.
