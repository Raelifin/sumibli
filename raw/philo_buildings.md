Sumibli doesn't have any esoteric philosophy of buildings, towns, et cetera. The most common seed words for talking about structures are:

|🎏ba|ba|area|edge
|🎏bu|bu|place|entity
|🎏flu|flu|door/window|building

Remember that the verb forms of these words relate the two nouns to each other. So "dau" as a verb means something like "supports", "fastens", or "traps".

|🎏utau la flu|utau la flu|that's the door
|🎏uflu la
bu luri ma|uflu la
bu luri ma|I'm at the building

Despite the word "uflu" meaning building, specific buildings are usually compounds with a root of "ba", in part because we usually want to talk about the place rather than the structure itself. For these words, the left meaning is the inside of the area and the right meaning is the edge of the area. In general, if you go to a place, but not inside, then you go to "uba"; if you go inside a place, you go to "iba".

|🎏bavai|bavai|shelter|wall/roof
|🎏babi|babi|market|boundary
|🎏baki|baki|home|boundary
|🎏bakai|bakai|restaurant/kitchen|boundary
|🎏baku|baku|restroom|boundary
|🎏baga|baga|power plant|boundary
|🎏bagu|bagu|road|sidewalk/curb
|🎏bani|bani|dormitory|boundary
|🎏bami|bami|library|boundary
|🎏barmau|barmau|museum|boundary
|🎏bafi|bafi|workplace|boundary
|🎏bafa|bafa|factory/studio|boundary
|🎏bafau|bafau|bank|boundary
|🎏bafla|bafla|park/arcade/stadium|boundary
|🎏basfla|basfla|school|boundary
|🎏badau|badau|floor/stage|boundary
|🎏bapdau|bapdau|prison|cell
|🎏bavzi|bavzi|church|boundary

These places are not even necessarily full structures in their own right. For instance, a kitchen in a house is still "bakai", and a bedroom is an example of "bani".

To talk about a structure, rather than a place, we can use "flu". The left meanings will consistently be about entrances/exits/windows/portals/etc and the right meaning will be about the structure itself.

|🎏fluvai|fluvai|hatch|bunker
|🎏flubi|flubi|store entrance|store
|🎏fluki|fluki|house door
(but not window)|house
|🎏flurgli|flurgli|window|structure
with window

Words with a "ba" root don't have to be buildings, of course. Any place can be "ba", even if it's large.

|🎏baka|baka|countryside/wilderness|farmland
|🎏bava|bava|town/city|outskirts/suburb
|🎏bavanu|bavanu|village|boundary
|🎏bavadu|bavadu|city/metropolis|city limits
