We can think of language as an exercise in turning concepts into symbols, encoded either as sound or as images, and then interpreting these symbols back into concepts. To make this more precise, we're going to define a mathematical object: the Sumibli expression or "💻ri💬". We provide notes on tbe semantics of 💻ri💬 (though we can't do this formally since the world isn't a formal language!). Additionally, we specify the grammar of 💻ri💬 - how to encode and decode it as sound/images.

This page will be pretty technical. It's recommended that you at least read the basics before diving in, but it's not strictly necessary. If formal systems are not your cup of tea, don't worry about reading this page. Sumibli is meant to be easy to learn and speak without having to dig into the math behind it. It's simply good if 🔈somebody💬 knows the answer to technicals question about the language, and this document serves as a resource for that.
