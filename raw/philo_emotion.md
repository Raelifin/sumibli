Emotions are complex things that require a multitude of words to convey. The most foundational aspect of emotion is 🔈valence💬 – how positive or negative an experience is. English valence words are oriented towards the positive, with low valence states being characterized by words like "unpleasant", "unhappy", or "unappealing". With valence, and all the other emotions discussed here, one should keep in mind that while dichotomies exist, actual people can feel both ways simultaneously.

Sumibli speakers often express emotion by using 🔗\🎓#Attitudinals attitudinals💬 – small interjections that convey some feeling about the speaker. For instance, the attitudinal for feeling good (high-valence) is "hi" and the attitudinal for feeling bad (low-valence) is "hu". Unlike most words, attitudinals don't have a left/right meaning.

|🎏hi|hi|😄 (positive)
|🎏hu|hu|😦 (negative)

There are also standard words that allow discussion of emotions, or expressing what someone else is feeling. These words all start with "pau", which has a left meaning of "emotional (person)" and a right meaning of "emotion". Emotion words all follow this general pattern: the left meaning is the subject who feels the emotion, while the right meaning is the feeling itself. In this document we'll simply give one definition, and leave it to the reader to understand the left/right division.

The second-most foundational aspect of emotion is 🔈arousal💬 – how activating or calming an experience is. Arousal in humans ties in with the sympathetic nervous system (for increasing arousal) and parasympathetic nervous system (for decreasing arousal). High arousal states can be pleasant or unpleasant – the axis of arousal is independent of valence.

|🎏hai|hai|😮 (activated)
|🎏ha|ha|😐 (calm)
|🎏pauga|pauga|😮 (activated)
|🎏paudau|paudau|😐 (calm)

Again orthogonal to these two axes of emotion sits the feels of confusion and clarity. Take care: the attitudinal for confusion 🔗\🎓#AnsweringQuestions turns a sentence into a question💬 by default.

|🎏hau|hau|😕 (confused)
|🎏hia|hia|👁️ (clear)
|🎏pauti|pauti|😕 (confused)
|🎏paugli|paugli|👁️ (clear)

These six basic feelings are only the start of a whole world of emotional expression. Complex attitudinals and emotion words exist (or should exist) for all major needs. Here we'll list many of the emotional words, both as an attitudinal and as a standard word.
