In the 🔗\🎓 basics of Sumibli💬, we introduce the words "chia" and "chiu" for talking about statements and requests, respectively. There is another pair of words that mirrors these two: "chai" and "chui".

Let's start with "chui". A sentence that starts with this word is a command. Similar to a request, it is not a comment on how the world is as much as it's about how the world should be. And unlike "chiu", which softly notes a preference without any implication of bad consequences for failing to satisfy the speaker, "chui" sentences have an implied threat behind them. The word "chui" is rude and violent, implying an ability to force the listener to comply with one's desire, or at least to fight if they don't comply.

English has somewhat distinct ways of making requests vs commands, so hopefully the distinction between "chiu" and "chui" is clear. Unlike English, Sumibli also distinguishes between two different ways of making statements. One framing of this distinction is as "perspective" vs "assertion".

A sentence that starts with "chai" is an assertion. There is an implication that the listener agrees with what is being said, and that what is being said should be adopted as a standard way of thinking about things. Much like with a command, there is a kind of blunt force to an assertion that can be violent in contexts where people might see things differently. Another way of thinking about "chai" sentences, is that they put forth a frame that others can engage with as a social construct, including by rejecting.

Sentences like "In this house we wash our hands" is a "chai" sentence, as is "That's against the rules" or "I'm the manager of this restaurant".

Thus, in contrast, sentences that start with "chia" should be heard as subjective, soft claims. These are statements not of hard fact, but of sharing the perspective of the speaker, and adding data to common knowledge. There is no implication that people should agree with a perspective, and often there's an implication that each person sees their own version of the truth. A common translation of "chia" is "I believe".
