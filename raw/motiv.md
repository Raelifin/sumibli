what we are trying to do
and what we want Sumibli to be

The real story for why Sumibli exists is as an exercise in perfectionism. There is a certain kind of aesthetic stance that one can take, where each flaw in something, no matter how minor, is intollerable. One would rather start from scratch than endure one wrong brushstroke on the canvas. One would invent an entire language from scratch rather than have to endure the confusion of "want two" versus "want to".

This kind of thinking is often quite counterproductive. It literally gets in the way of production, demanding that things that are good enough be rejected. But perfectionism is also a virtue. No truly amazing things are created without a healthy dose of perfectionism; it is through the aesthetic lens of the perfect that we become awake to the opportunities to do better.

It is impossible to be perfect in all ways. The lens of the perfect says it is better to be perfect in some ways and terrible in others rather than generally mediocre. Thus Sumibli is designed to be perfect according to a core set of principles. If you ever wonder why an aspect of Sumibli is the way it is, the story should ultimately trace back to one of the principles listed here. Another way of framing this list is as a description of what virtues Sumibli aspires to have.

One might wonder why bother with making a language like Sumibli when Lojban and Toki Pona both exist. The short answer is that ðŸ”—motiv_lojban Lojban is grossðŸ’¬ and ðŸ”—motiv_toki Toki Pona is oversimplifiedðŸ’¬. From frame of utopian perfectionism, neither suffice. Sumibli seeks to be a third way.

Let's dive in!

ðŸ“›Utility

More than anything else, Sumibli strives to be an effective tool for communication. Expressing ideas, complex or simple, should be easy and efficient for fluent speakers. Expressions should be clear by default, with no need to avoid linguistic traps or edge-cases. The language should allow for speakers to emphasize whatever is important to them, and to avoid forcing specificity on unimportant things.

ðŸ“›Purity

Sumibli is designed to be a language of first-principles, almost entirely rebuilt without reference to the languages, cultures, and customs of Old Earth. The design of words and grammar should stand on its own philosophy, rather than reference natural etymologies and legacy systems. Sumibli strives to lead the way into a glorious future, not be held back by naive or unconscious choices made by our ancestors.

ðŸ“›Simplicity

The language should be designed around principles of minimalism and regularity. It should be so simple that an average human can learn the basics in a single sitting and no aspect should be able to be simplified further without significant cost to the language's comprehensibility and general utility. Everything should follow a clean story and a regular pattern.

ðŸ“›Clarity

Sumibli should be clear, unambiguous, and precise, particularly in the context of computers. It should be hard to make spelling errors or come up with confusing sentences. Letters, words, glyphs, and sounds should be easy to distinguish. Precise concepts should be able to be expressed without fuss or added jargon. There should be a clear and easy mapping between written and spoken words.

ðŸ“›Typability

Sumibli is designed to be composed using a keyboard. Digital interfaces are ideal for linguistic expression, and keyboards are a surprisingly good means of inputting digital data. As such, written sumibli should be easy to read (but not necessarily easy to scribe with a pen). There should be ðŸ”—community_keyboard a keyboard that allows Sumibli to by written at the speed of thoughtðŸ’¬.

ðŸ“›Compatibility with English

Without sacrificing any of the above, the language should be easy to learn and speak by humans who are fluent in English in the year 2022. English words should be easy to transcode into the Sumibli alphabet without too much loss, and none of the Sumibli sounds should be outside of the repetoir of the average English speaker. Some consideration is made for other common languages, but English is the focus because that's what Max Harms speaks.
