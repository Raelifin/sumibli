Sumibli primarily uses the words "tu" and "tau" to talk about the positions of things. These position words are also heavily used when 🔗philo_tense talking about time💬.

|🎏tu|tu|previous|next
|🎏tau|tau|close|far

The three spacial dimensions, in order, are left↣right (pitch), top↣bottom (yaw), back↣front (roll). Each dimension is oriented, such that there is a positive and negative direction. The words for relative position in each dimension are all based on "tu", and have the negative on the left and the positive on the right.

|🎏tuma|tuma|left|right
|🎏tudu|tudu|above|below
|🎏tutu|tutu|behind|in front of

Of course, relative positions require a frame of reference. By default the reference frame is that of the speaker, but in some contexts it can be otherwise. Use "ulaisu" to specify, when ambiguous.

The easiest mnemonic for the orientations and order of the axes is that the follow how one reads text: we read each line left-to-right, then we read lines top-to-bottom, then we read pages back-to-front. The direction of the axes is non-arbitrary, in that most humans are right-handed, so writing left-to-right and top-to-bottom is more correct in that it reduces the risk of smudging ink with the palm.

One major gotcha for Sumibli orientations is that the positive direction in the y-axis is 🔈down💬. This is the easiest orientation when drawing on a document, as we write top-to-bottom. It's for this same reason that computer scientists/programmers traditionally move down as the y-values increase. Similarly, pilots have the yaw axis pointing downward. Old-Earth mathematicians, however, have the wrong convention and as a result have strange notions like the turning of the unit circle (as the angle increases) going anti-clockwise and may be surprised by Sumibli.

The word "ita" can mean "up", and can sometimes serve as an alternative to "itudu". Unlike "tudu", however, the default frame is not oriented on the speaker. If I'm upside-down, I might say that the world is "itudu", but it would be wrong to say it's "ita". Likewise, it is incorrect to use "ta" to describe positions in abstract domains or in zero-gravity.

|🎏ta|ta|up/tall/heavenward|that which is up high

We use "ta" and "dai" for most words describing orientation (even in abstract domains).

|🎏dai|dai|line|straight
|🎏tadai|tadai|vertical|tower
|🎏tandai|tandai|horizontal|table
|🎏tatau|tatau|leaning towards|downslope
|🎏tantau|tantau|leaning away|upslope
|🎏daidai|daidai|corner|orthoginal/angled
|🎏daisau|daisau|parallel objects|parallel direction

For similar reasons to left/right (pulling is easier than pushing and the right arm tends to be slightly stronger than the left), clockwise is the positive rotational direction and anti-clockwise is negative.

|🎏tukau|tukau|anti-clockwise|clockwise

Lastly, we have words for cardinal directions on a world:

|🎏tuga|tuga|north|south
|🎏tukla|tukla|west|east

The word "tukla" increases in the direction opposite the spin of the world (thus increasing the subjective position in the day cycle). Since the word "tuga" literally increases in the direction "towards heat", we think of it as being towards-the-equator for most people. The hemisphere the world with the majority of inhabitants is considered the "ituga"; magnetic north/south is an entirely different concept.
