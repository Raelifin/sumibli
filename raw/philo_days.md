Sumibli culture naturally measures time according to 🔗philo_units natural units💬, but also according to the natural rhythms and cycles of humans. Thus, Sumibli does not divide the day into evenly-sized hours, because hours are not a natural human quantity, but still has a notion of mornings, afternoons, evenings, and nights. (Computers help with scheduling things at consistent times; in the absence of good technology, barbarian units of time like hours can be used.)

Routines of work and rest are coordinated around weeks that are arranged into a series of six days, referred to by "tha klaga_si", where the blank is one of the first six consonants. Every five weeks forms one month. See 🔗philo_weather#Seasons Seasons💬 for more.
