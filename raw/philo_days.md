📛Days

Sumibli culture naturally measures time according to 🔗philo_units natural units💬, but also according to the natural rhythms and cycles of humans. Thus, Sumibli does not divide the day into evenly-sized hours, because hours are not a natural human quantity, but still has a notion of mornings, afternoons, evenings, and nights. (Computers help with scheduling things at consistent times; in the absence of good technology, barbarian units of time like hours can be used.)

Routines of work and rest are coordinated around weeks that are arranged into a series of six days, referred to by "tha klaga_sai", where the blank is one of the first six consonants.

📛Seasons

Sumibli philosophy puts forth that there are two primary seasons, which can roughly be translated into "spring/summer" and "autumn/winter". The peak of the warm season is when the days are longest, and the heart of the cold season is when days are shortest. These primary seasons can be subdivided into early/late halves.

|🎏klata|klata|year|annual
|🎏klatata|klatata|season|seasonal
|🎏klatatga|klatatga|spring/summer|vernal/estival
|🎏klatatna|klatatna|autumn/winter|autumnal/brumal
|🎏klatatgatu|klatatgatu|spring|summer
|🎏klatatnatu|klatatnatu|autumn|winter

As with weather, it's more common to talk about the primary seasons than their early/late parts. Often the right translation of "klatatga" is just "summer", for instance.

Sumibli Earth culture divides the calendar into 360 normal days with either 5 or 6 holidays ("strange days"). Each season is 180 days and can be divided into six months of 30 days each. (See 🔗philo_days Days, Times, and Weeks💬 for more.) The start of the year is on the vernal equinox, and has two holidays. The solstices each have one holiday, and the autumnal equinox has either one or two holidays depending on if it's a leap-year.
