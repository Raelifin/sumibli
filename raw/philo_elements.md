📛Atoms

The word "sa" means "single\|multiple" or "element\|set". We combine this word with "da", the word for "stuff", to talk about the most basic thing that composes matter: atoms.

|🎏sa|sa|single|multiple
|🎏da|da|thing|substance
|🎏sada|sada|atom|elemental

We can indicate a small number of atoms in the normal ways.

|🎏sadatsi|sadatsi|two atoms|atom-pair substance

|🎏isada shu sipata|isada shu sipata|there are twelve atoms

Words rooted in "sada" have a common pattern of the left meaning being that of a countable number of atoms (such as a single atom), and a right meaning being a substance composed of many such atoms (often a metal). In this document we'll provide only one definition and let the reader construct the appropriate meaning.

The general naming scheme with atoms is to relate them to their atomic number – the number of protons in the atom's nucleus. A simple way of naming atoms is to say "first atom" to reference hydrogen, "second atom" to indicate helium, etc. Another simple way is by augmenting "sada" with an entire number. When using this second method the number is simply the number of protons in the nucleus.

|🎏sadash sida|sadash sida|lithium

Neither of these methods is the primary way of talking about elements, however. The standard method is to provide a suffix which can be interpreted just like a 🔗philo_number number💬 in base-eight, with element zero being helium, element one being lithium, and element negative-one being hydrogen. Why base-eight? This way the 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(periodic_table) group💬 of the element (and therefore much of its behavior) can be easily gleaned from the name.

We run into trouble at scandium. How do we handle the transition metals? If we just naively continue our naming scheme, we'll find that the base-eight convention ceases to let us predict anything about the properties of the element. Instead, we treat the transition metals as being named by a fraction in base-ten and then just the period. Some examples will make things clear.

|🎏sadapita|sadapita|scandium
|🎏sadabita|sadabita|titanium
|🎏sadatita|sadatita|vanadium
|🎏sadadita|sadadita|chromium
|🎏sadakita|sadakita|manganese

When we get to the lanthanides, we switch our fractional system to permit bridge-consonants. Bridge consonants are used for the f-block of inner transitional metals. The consonant clusters for the f-block elements are optimized for being pronouncible and distinct, at the cost of having an easy description.

|🎏sadaspika|sadaspika|lanthanum

📛Molecules and Salts

Sumibli also has a convenient system for naming elemental compounds such as H₂O or NaCl. Instead of "sada", which indicates a substance of mostly one kind of atom, we use the word "kluda" to indicate a mixed-substance.

|🎏klu|klu|mixture|ingredients
|🎏kluda|kluda|object made from
an alloy/salt/molecules|alloy/salt/molecules
|🎏klusada|klusada|molecule|made of molecules

If a word starts with "kluda" we can augment it with a suffix just like we would "sada". If we simply do so, the word means "a compound including [the element]". All words beginning with "kluda" have a left-meaning of an object (or pool/region if non-solid) made from the substance and a right-meaning of the substance itself. As before, this distinction will be left to the reader.

|🎏kludaka|kludaka|organic/containing carbon

We can augment twice to indicate a compound made of two kinds of atoms. The second set of augmenting syllables use "u" instead of "a". We can do this any number of times, alternating between "u" and "a" each time (even when one of the elements is hydrogen, which uses "au" instead of either "u" or "a").

|🎏kludakanu|kludakanu|containing carbon and oxygen
|🎏kludababa|kludababamubu|containing sodium and chlorine

Words like "kludakanu" are vague, in that they don't specify an exact chemical code. It could describe carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even something like acetic acid, despite the missing reference to hydrogen. (Similarly, "kludaka" could be graphite, diamond, or methane.) To be more precise, give a number after at least one of the atomic codes in the word by giving a consonant followed by the vowel "ai". Molecular words containing at least one "ai" vowel are supposed to be read as chemical codes, where elided numbers are implicitly 1.

|🎏kludakanutai|kludakanutai|CO₂
|🎏kludabautainu|kludabautainu|H₂O
|🎏kludakabaudaikanunabau|kludakabaudaikanunabau|CH₃COOH
