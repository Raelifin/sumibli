The web font used to render strings like "🎏sumibligli💬" is a bit of a hack. I'm not a FontForge pro, and just whipped up a font that has all of the Sumibli letters at 0-width, then space them out by hand (actually with the website generator) using invisible characters. This is definitely the wrong way to do it; the right way would be using ligatures to dynamically compose glyphs. But, alas, that is beyond me at the moment. If you have skill at making fonts, and want to contribute, please contact me by email at 🔗mailto:raelifin@gmail.com raelifin@gmail.com💬.
