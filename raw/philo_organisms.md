All living things are classified under the core word of "ki", which means "organism", or just "living thing". In particular, "ki" are beings that arose from accidental/natural processes ("ka") and which sustain and/or copy their pattern when given ample resources. Artificial/planned beings are not "ki", nor are inanimate organic structures like stars or crystals. This is not to say that these beings can't be said to be "alive", but rather that they're excluded from the definition of "ki", and insofar as the speaker wants to talk about a kind of life that includes, say, robots, they must craft a more specific concept that specifies that.

There’s been a push in recent decades to see genetics as the fundamental guide to classifying organisms. While this makes sense in many situations, it seems obviously bad in most. In short, if one sticks to genetics, there’s no such thing as a tree or a fish. In Sumibli we want to talk about such things, so the words for organisms are broken down into a hierarchy based on physical characteristics.

Words are meant as mental paintbrushes that help each other express concepts. If I were to say “They landed on the shores of the island and found it covered with strange plants.” I don’t really want you to infer that the organisms on the island were descended from an ancient organism that engulfed cyanobacteria and gave rise to ferns, grass, and pine trees. I want you to infer that the organisms were big and stationary. If the “plants” on the island turned out to be small furry creatures that just happened to be descended from the same common ancestor as sunflowers, you’d probably object to my description. Aristotle and young children both have this right: seaweed and mushrooms and trees all belong to a group that’s useful to talk about with a short word.

|🎏kidau|kidau|plant
(macroscopic and
mostly stationary)|of-a-plant
|🎏kidaudu|kidaudu|tree
("big/heavy plant")|wood

What about jellyfish, barnacles, venus fly traps, or any of the other many edge-cases? We, as speakers of the language, simply make a judgment call as to which word to use and/or look up the correct word in the dictionary. The point is not that the taxonomy is a perfect sorting of all organisms, but rather that it carves what we see into natural categories that are useful in day-to-day life.

The taxonomy is also compatible with alternative taxonomies. For example, if you’re a biologist you may be interested in making a distinction between organisms based on their ancestry. This way of carving up the world compliments the common way, and allows us to add a different connotation (physiology vs ancestry) when talking about the same organisms.

|🎏kipsi|kipsi|one organism|bacteria
("first organisms")
|🎏kibsi|kibsi|two organisms|archaea
("second organisms")
|🎏kitsi|kitsi|three organisms|eukaryota
("third organisms")

There is no ancestry-based group of organisms that includes all trees but not some things that are obviously-not-trees. As such, we leave lineage-based taxonomy to the biologists and continue with the task of naming organisms based on how they’re shaped.

To talk about microscopic life, we lean on four primary words:

|🎏kinu|kinu|microbe|microbial
|🎏kibnu|kibnu|cell|cellular
|🎏suki|suki|genes|genetic
|🎏nainki|nainki|pathogen|rotten

At the macroscopic level, we have one main word for animals: "kai". Then, we have a host of words that divide the set of animals into many taxa. Remember, that each category is non-exclusive. An animal can easily be both a predator and a bird, for example. The right-meaning for each animal word is an action that is considered the archtypical behavior of that kind of animal. When these words are used as verbs, many times they are used metaphorically to say that the subject is (for example) like-a-bird (eg flying) rather than literally one of those animals.

|🎏kai|kai|animal
|🎏kainu|kainu|insect
("small animals")|crawling/squirming
|🎏kaiku|kaiku|fish
("water animals")|swimming
|🎏kaita|kaita|birds
("air animals")|flying
|🎏kainau|kainau|reptile
(or other
cold-blooded animal)|basking/napping
|🎏kaiga|kaiga|mammal
(or other
warm-blooded animal)|strolling/wandering
|🎏kainai|kainai|predators
("attack animals")|hunting
|🎏kaivau|kaivau|herbivores
("peace animals")|hiding
|🎏kaivi|kaivi|pets
(or other

the animal
("owner"/"master")

We consider all animals that live in water most of their life "kaiku". Fish are classic "kaiku", and we typically translate the word as "fish", but lobsters, starfish, whales, manatees, and sea snakes all count as "kaiku". Remember, we're not distinguishing based on phylogeny, but rather on whether the animals are naturally connected to the water! Animals such as seals, otters, frogs, penguins, leeches, and sea turtles can all be correctly described as "kaiku", but they are non-central examples of the conceptual category.

Animals that fly are "kaita". Geese, bats, bees, and pterodactyls are all good examples of "kaita". Flying squirrels, chickens, and cockroaches are "kaita", but non-central.

Note that, just like we get different lenses on the same organism with phylogeny and physiology, we can use different applicable words in the taxonomy to take different views of the same creature. A penguin, when seen as "kaiga", is clumsy, but when seen as "kaiku", is graceful.
