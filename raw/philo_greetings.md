Sumibli doesn't have interjections in the same way that languages like English do. It has attitudinals, for expressing emotion, and for many interjections these suffice. For example, "himvi" means "I feel grateful", and can be splashed into a sentence or used on its own as a way of saying "thanks". Likewise, "hibva" is "I feel welcoming" and is a common response to those who say "himvi".

But these attitudinals are limited to short bursts of feeling. The "interjections" of greetings, farewells, and other expressions in the same category take the form of sentences, albeit short ones.

When two people meet, a standard greeting is "mu". This literally means "a conversation is going to happen", and can less-literally be translated as "hello". (Note: "imu" is how one references "we" – aka everyone in the conversation.)

Another common greeting is "vau", which literally means "there is peace between those who are aligned". This is a warmer greeting than "mu", and implies that the other person shares your values. Where "mu" implies you want to talk, "vau" can also be used in passing or as a farewell.

We can augment "vau" and "mu" to involve a time of day. As before, words beginning with "mu" can be used as a greeting that implies you want to talk, where words starting with "vau" are ambiguously greetings or farewells.

|🎏mush klagi|mush klagi|Good day!
|🎏vaush klangi|vaush klangi|Peaceful night!
|🎏vaush nikai|vaush nikai|Peaceful sleep!
|🎏mush ninkai|mush ninkai|Awakening-hello.

In addition to times of day and words about sleeping, all sorts of creative words can be attached to "vau" and "mu" to contextualize the expression.

|🎏mush takuni|mush takuni|Rainy-hello!
|🎏vaush tati|vaush tati|Sunny-peace!
|🎏mupau|mupau|Emotional-hello!

One should be careful around certain augments, however, as the meaning can change quite dramatically. For instance, "mutau" is a way of saying goodbye, or more literally "talk to you then".

|🎏mutau|mutau|See you later!

A more elaborate way of saying farewell, is to implore the listener to take care of themselves.
