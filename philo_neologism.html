The existing Sumibli dictionary isn’t going to be complete enough for everything a person wants to say, and so it’s up to everyone to create sensible definitions for the neologisms that they invent.</p>
<p>When a compound is formed, we see the meaning of the compound as having the same basic structure as the root. For example, we consider the word “kibli” (organ) to be a refinement of the concept of “ki” (organism). Note that it not necessary that the compound be obviously a sub-category of the root; organs are not really a kind of organism. Rather, the root serves the starting place for understanding the compound on an intuitive level. It's usually good to have the compound at least be more-or-less a refinement of the root if you squint at it, but the intuitive meaning (eg organism+part = organ) should dominate. (Intuitions vary, however, so be careful!)</p>
<p>When two roots would work equally well, we prefer common/short roots, and those that are more specific (eg “ki”), rather than those that are vague (eg “da”).</p>
<p>The augment in a compound should be seen as a hint or a flavoring to the root, rather than just a simple adjective. Remember that we’re building concepts here, rather than noun-phrases. Is “valuable organ” a natural concept in itself, or just the fusion of two unrelated concepts? Augments should be evocative and dramatic when possible, without needing to be literal. (Eg: want+organ = hand.)</p>
<p>Remember that all standard words have both a left and right meaning, and this relates to the meaning of the word as a verb. All three meanings should be kept in mind when creating neologisms. As a first-pass, combine the left meaning of the root with the left meaning of the augment and the same on the right. The result can often be straightforwardly interpreted using the same verb-relation that the root had.</p>
<table><tr><td>iki + ibli</td><td>living being + subdivided</td><td>divided organism</td></tr><tr><td>uki + ubli</td><td>that which has been grown + part</td><td>grown part</td></tr><tr><td>ki + bli</td><td>grew + can be divided into</td><td>grew into parts</td></tr></table>
<p>In other cases, one of the two meanings naturally dominates the other. In the case of “kiblipi” we see agency/reaching-for/grasping-at as the essential hint, rather than being-desired. In these cases we apply the hint to the meanings of the root, trying to keep the relationship between the left and right meanings close to those of the root (has an organ + agency = has a hand).</p>
<p>Finally, the specificity of a compound should be roughly exponential in the word's length. Short compounds should be fairly general, and cover a wide swath of concept-space, while longer compounds should hone-in on the concept quickly, rather than wasting vocal space being overly-specific. There are budgets in both namespace-clutter and in speaking-time that need to be minimized.</p>
