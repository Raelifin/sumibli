<h2 id='TheSumibliAlphabet'>The Sumibli Alphabet</h2>
<p>Sumibli can be written using an alphabet of 20 letters. These letters are each associated with a particular sound, and have a “conceptual atmosphere”. The letter “g”, for instance, sounds like the leading consonant in “go”, and is associated with the concepts of action, motion, fire, and the number 5 (among other things). When letters are combined into a word, the meaning and usage of that word can be guessed by the letters that compose it. In this way, the alphabet for Sumibli forms a kind of loose taxonomy of concepts, and it's very helpful to start with the basics of this taxonomy.</p>
<p>By the way, the letter “g” in Sumibli isn't canonically written as such. Sumibli uses its own script, which represents that same letter as “<span class="sumibli"><u>g-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span>g</span></del></span>”. We'll usually provide Sumibli text with both the Latin version and the native Sumibli script, for ease of learning.</p>

<h2 id='AlphabetPatterns'>Alphabet Patterns</h2>
<p>Twenty letters is a lot to take in, especially when each comes attached to a meaning. It helps if we break up the alphabet into groups of letters based on some simple patterns.</p>
<p>The first six letters form a group of <em>plosives</em> that all have a similar sound. Try sounding out “pa ba ta da ka ga” to yourself. Each plosive involves briefly stopping the air coming out of your lungs. They occur in order, starting from the lips and moving towards the back of the mouth, with every other sound (b, d, g) being “voiced” by action in the throat. (This pattern of voiced consonants occurring right after their unvoiced counterparts (“tada”) is a general pattern across the alphabet.</p>
<p>The number six is important in Sumibli, and there are six plosives. These are the letters most commonly associated with a number, and their symbols in the Sumibli script are drawn with a number of strokes equal to their order in the alphabet.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the next six consonants: n, m, f, v, s, and z. Together with the plosives, these form the <em>standard consonants</em>. The standard consonants roughly appear in order of increasing abstraction. The first six are about primal, elemental things, and the second six are about civilizational, abstract things.</p>
<p>The final five consonants in the alphabet (h, th, sh, r and l) are called <em>odd constants</em> because they are used differently than the others. We'll talk about words that use these letters later, but the basic story is that words that start with odd consonants are used to give structure to sentences and do things that would break the rules of how standard words work.</p>
<p>The three <em>vowels</em> (i, a, and u) don't have a lot of meaning in themselves. But the general story is that they're lined up from the tightest (“i”) to the loosest (“u”) and can similarly be seen as going from near to far, with “a” being in the middle.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='PronunciationTipsforConsonants'>Pronunciation Tips for Consonants</h2>
<p>Sumibli consonants mostly sound as you'd expect from seeing the latin equivalent. But we should briefly mention some things about three of the odd consonants: h, th, and sh.</p>
<p>The letter “h” is represented by an empty space in the native Sumibli script. It is conventional not to pronounce “h” unless it shows up between two vowels (that aren't supposed to be a diphthong). When we write Sumibli using the Latin alphabet it is also conventional to we only write the “h” when it would be pronounced. When in doubt, leave “h” out!</p>
<p>The letter “th” (sometimes written “x”) also can be either voiced or unvoiced, sounding either like “<strong>th</strong>is” or like “wi<strong>th</strong>”, <em>depending on where it shows up in a word</em>. The voiced version is correct at the start (or middle) of words, while the unvoiced is correct at the end of words, exactly like in the example of “<strong>th</strong>is” vs “wi<strong>th</strong>”.</p>
<p>The letter “sh” (sometimes written “j”) is usually pronounced like the first sound in “<strong>sh</strong>oe” but can also be pronounced like the first sound in “<strong>g</strong>enre” or the last sound in “mira<strong>ge</strong>”. In other words, Sumibli doesn't distinguish the voiced and unvoiced versions of the sound. In certain circumstances the letter “sh” comes after “t”. This combo is pronounced like the start of “<strong>ch</strong>air”.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='Diphthongs'>Diphthongs</h2>
<p>When two different Sumibli vowels appear directly next to each other, they combine into a diphthong. You can read <a href="spec.html" class="no-underline"><u>the full specification</u></a> if you want all the details, but here's the basic pronunciation guide:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Sumibli Diphthong </th><th> Latin Equivalent </th><th> Pronunciation Guide</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Ia-</u><del><span>h</span><span>ia</span><span></span></del></td><td>ia</td><td><strong>yaw</strong></td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Iu-</u><del><span>h</span><span>iu</span><span></span></del></td><td>iu</td><td><strong>you</strong></td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Ai-</u><del><span>h</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del></td><td>ai</td><td><strong>eye</strong></td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Au-</u><del><span>h</span><span>au</span><span></span></del></td><td>au</td><td><strong>ou</strong>ch</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Ui-</u><del><span>h</span><span>ui</span><span></span></del></td><td>ui</td><td><strong>we</strong></td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Ua-</u><del><span>h</span><span>ua</span><span></span></del></td><td>ua</td><td><strong>wa</strong>nt</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_pronunciation.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='SeedWords'>Seed Words</h2>
<p>The simplest Sumibli words are a single syllable that starts with a standard consonant and ends with a vowel. These are called “seed words” because they're the etymological foundation of larger words, and are the basis of all Sumibli expressions. Seed words are the simplest kind of “<strong>standard words</strong>” - words that start with a standard consonant.</p>
<p>When we write Sumibli in the native script, each syllable forms a glyph. The opening consonant of a syllable is on top, the closing consonant (which seed words lack) is on the bottom, and the vowels are in the middle. The only exception to this is “L”, which can show up in the middle section, before a vowel.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>pa<br/>(“pah”)</td><td>person</td><td>personality</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>blu<br/>(“bloo”)</td><td>simple</td><td>structure</td></tr></table>
<p>When we give a definition of a standard Sumibli word, we'll see two translations for that word. This is, perhaps, the most difficult aspect of Sumibli: all standard words have a “left meaning” and a “right meaning”.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='SoloSentences'>Solo Sentences</h2>
<p>The most basic sentences in Sumibli consist of a standard word being used all by itself. We know two standard words already, so we therefore know two sentences.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>pa</td><td>there is a person<br/>with a personality</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>blu</td><td>there were simple things<br/>with a particular structure</td></tr></table>
<p>The English translation of these sentences adds quite a lot of detail. Sumibli, by default, is <em>vague</em>, and doesn't specify things like quantity, definiteness (“the” vs “a”), or tense. Later we'll see how to specify these things, but for now we should keep in mind that the English translations are always going to be approximate.</p>
<p>Here are some alternative translations of the sentence “blu”:</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>blu</td><td>the basics<br/>follow a pattern</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>blu</td><td>there's an order<br/>to things that are simple</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>blu</td><td>a simple one<br/>will have a structure</td></tr></table>
<p>Notice that in these kinds of sentences, both the left and right meanings of the word are used in the translation. We can think of the word in a trivial sentence as being a verb that relates a left noun and a right noun (both of which are vague and unspecified).</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='OrientedWords'>Oriented Words</h2>
<p>We can also make a Sumibli sentence from a single word by tacking “i” or “u” onto the front of it. These prefixes indicate whether we're in “left mode” or “right mode”.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ipa</td><td>there is a person</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>O-</u><del><span>h</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>upa</td><td>there are personalities</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>iblu</td><td>something will be simple</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>O-</u><del><span>h</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>Blu-</u><del><span>b</span><span>lu</span><span></span></del></td><td>ublu</td><td>there was a pattern</td></tr></table>
<p>Again, the English forces us to invent a tense, etc for the sentences. The thing to focus on is that the orientation prefix focuses the sentence onto either the left or right meaning of the word. When used like this, we think of the word as being a noun. When a sentence lacks a verb, it's implied to be about existence of the noun.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_orientedWords.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='MeYouandOtherWords'>Me, You, and Other Words</h2>
<p>Consider the word “ma”:</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ma<br/>(“mah”)</td><td>communicator</td><td>topic</td></tr></table>
<p>In typical Sumibli fashion, “ma” is vague about what kind of communication it's about. It could be talking, writing, body language, or even fashion. Sumibli words are meant to be composable, such that it's easy to add on details to a vague seed.</p>
<p>The word “ma” is also a way Sumibli speakers can talk about themselves, similar to the pronouns “I” and “me” in English. The distinction between the person who is currently communicating (ie “me”) and some other communicator of interest, must be worked out through context.</p>
<p>Likewise, this is the best translation for “you”:</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>BY-</u><del><span>b</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>bi<br/>(“bee”)</td><td>collector</td><td>aquisition</td></tr></table>
<p>Because “bi” is vague, the aquisition can be information, and the collector can be a listener/reader.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>BY-</u><del><span>b</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>bi</td><td>someone gets something</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>BY-</u><del><span>b</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>bi</td><td>someone read something</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>BY-</u><del><span>b</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>bi</td><td>someone will learn something</td></tr></table>
<p>Here are a couple other words we'll be using:</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del></td><td>kai<br/>(rhymes with “sigh”)</td><td>animal</td><td>behavior</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>GY-</u><del><span>g</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>gi<br/>(rhymes with “see”)</td><td>fast</td><td>motion</td></tr></table>
<p>Note that the right-meanings of the words “kai” and “gi” might seem like synonyms, but they differ in the connotation. When a rock falls down a hill, the motion is an example of “ugi”, but not “ukai”. When a lizard basks in the sun it's an instance of “ukai” but not “ugi”.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_basicVocab.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='SimpleSentences'>Simple Sentences</h2>
<p>We've examined how to make sentences out of single words, but what if we want to say something more complex, like “the animal is fast”? One easy way to do this is with the word “la”. Notice that “la” doesn't start with a standard consonant and thus is not a standard word.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>GY-</u><del><span>g</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>ikai la gi</td><td>the animal is fast</td></tr></table>
<p>We think of “la” as marking the end of one <em>phrase</em> (in this case “ikai”) and the start of another (“gi”). In a sentence like the one provided, “la” marks the first phrase as the subject and the second phrase as the verb. In other words, we are saying “a fast thing moves” but providing the additional detail that the fast thing is an animal.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>O-</u><del><span>h</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>GY-</u><del><span>g</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>ukai la gi</td><td>the behavior is fast</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ipa la ma</td><td>a person speaks</td></tr></table>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_simpleSentences.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='ExplicitSubjectParticles'>Explicit Subject Particles</h2>
<p>The word “la” is a <em>phrase particle</em> – a small word that marks the start of a phrase. In the case of “la” it's a verb phrase. In the last section we saw sentences with two phrases, where the first phrase had no phrase particle. This is just a shorthand; we can use the phrase particle “li” (pronounced “lee”) to explicitly mark the subject's noun phrase.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>O-</u><del><span>h</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>LY-</u><del><span>l</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>GY-</u><del><span>g</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>uli kai la gi</td><td>the behavior is fast</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>LY-</u><del><span>l</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ili pa la ma</td><td>a person speaks</td></tr></table>
<p>Note that when we do this, the orientation prefix (“i-” or “u-”) comes at the very start of the sentence, before the first phrase particle.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='PhraseParticleTricks'>Phrase Particle Tricks</h2>
<p>It's normal to put the subject of a Sumibli sentence first, followed by the verb, but Sumibli sentences are highly flexible. Thanks to the phrase particles we can put the phrases in whatever order feels best for what we're trying to express.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LY-</u><del><span>l</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ila ma li pa</td><td>a person speaks</td></tr></table>
<p>Similar to before, we can drop the “la” when it occurs at the beginning of the sentence – the “li” at the start of the second phrase implies that the first phrase is the verb.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LY-</u><del><span>l</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ima li pa</td><td>a person speaks</td></tr></table>
<p>Another advantage of phrase particles is that we can easily mark multiple subjects or multiple verbs. This is the easiest way of saying “and” in Sumibli.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><br/><u>LY-</u><del><span>l</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ikai la ma<br/>li pa</td><td>an animal and a person spoke</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>PE-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><br/><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>GY-</u><del><span>g</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>ipa la ma<br/>la gi</td><td>the person is speaking<br/>and they're fast</td></tr></table>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_phraseParticleTricks.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='AdjectivesandAdverbs'>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
<p>We now know how to say “the person is speaking and they're fast”, but this isn't the same as “the fast person speaks” or “the person speaks quickly”. It implies that the person is being fast at the same time as they're speaking, but that the speed isn't necessarily about their speech. To say these other sentences, we want to gain the ability to use standard words as adjectives or adverbs. To do so, we can use the non-standard word “shu”.</p>

<p>We often think of “shu” as making one of the words an adjective/adverb, but we can also think of it as talking about the intersection of two concepts. A fast person is in the intersection of people and fast things. To speak quickly is in the intersection of speaking and being fast. As a result, the order of the words doesn't matter for “shu”.</p>

<h2 id='SimpleFlips'>Simple Flips</h2>
<p>As we know, the prefix for a sentence tells us whether we should use the left or right meanings for the nouns in that sentence. But if we want to use a mixture of left <em>and</em> right meanings we'll need to add a new tool to our toolkit: the letter “r”.</p>
<p>The letter “r” always shows up immediately after a vowel, never at the start of a syllable. In most situations it means that the words that come after it have a flipped orientation to the words that come before. Thus, if we start in right-mode, the presence of an “r” will put us into left-mode, and vice-versa. A common place to add an “r” is as a suffix to a phrase particle.</p>

<p>Another common location is as a suffix to “shu”. If we flip orientation in the middle of a verb phrase it means that the following verbs are reversed compared to the preceding verbs (in addition to flipping the orientation of subsequent nouns).</p>

<h2 id='ResettingtheOrientation'>Resetting the Orientation</h2>
<p>The left/right orientation of words in a sentence can be difficult for novice speakers to track. As a way of assisting communication, it is permitted to follow the letter “r” with either “i” or “u” to explicitly set the orientation of the words after it, rather than simply flipping the previous orientation. For example, if the orientation is left-mode, because of starting a sentence with “i-”, one can set it to right mode with “-ru” instead of just “-r”.</p>
<p>It is grammatically legal, but considered very bad style to explicitly set the orientation in a place where no flip occurs (eg by setting things to left-mode when one is already in left-mode). Thus, in most texts, one can drop vowels after “r” without any change to the meaning.</p>

<h2 id='Compounds'>Compounds</h2>
<p>So far we've been restricting ourselves to standard words that are only a single syllable. But now let's consider what happens when two seed words come in contact with each other. This structure is called a “compound” and is similar to compound words in English like “snow-man” or “air-plane”.</p>
<p>A snowman is not really a man made of snow, and it's certainly not a snowy man. Instead, compounds are new concepts that can have a distinct meaning in the dictionary. For example, we use “ikai shu gi” to say “fast animal”, but this is a very different thing from “ikai gi”, which we normally write as “ikaigi” when using Latin text. An ikaigi is a rabbit, squirrel, deer, gazelle, or other animal that relies mainly on being a very fast sprinter for survival. Ikaigi are fast animals, but they're a more specific class than just animals that are fast (see <a href="philo_organisms.html" class="no-underline"><u>the philosophy of animals</u></a> for more).</p>

<p>Unlike with “shu”, order matters when forming compounds through juxtaposition. A snow-man is not the same as man-snow, and it's the same way in Sumibli. We treat the first word as the <em>root</em> and the second word as the <em>augment</em>. The meaning of a compound will usually more closely resemble the root, with the augment as something like a (sometimes metaphorical) hint.</p>

<p>Despite the danger of misusing a compound, Sumibli speakers are encouraged to try to use lots of compounds (instead of falling back on “shu”), and even make them up on the spot. What is a “ikaipa”? It's not in the dictionary, but we can guess it means something like “sentient animal”. If I want to talk about animal-people, “ikaipa” serves my goal at least as well as “ikai shu pa”.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href="practice_compounds.html">🎮</a> <a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='Suffixes'>Suffixes</h2>
<p>Compounds are multi-syllable words. We can easily make a compound by attaching a seed word to a root. But we can also provide a “bridge consonant” in-between, which modifies the resulting compound.</p>
<p>For example, the word “isi” means “number”. So “ikaisi” could be translated as “a number of animals”. The letter “t” is the second one in the alphabet, and when we use it as a bridge to “si” it makes the whole augment mean “double”, “twice”, or just “two”. We can use this to specify the number of things or actions.</p>

<p>We can't say “tsi” (or “itsi”) by itself, but we can easily attach it to the very generic word “ida” which means “thing” (including abstract things and living things).</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>DE-</u><del><span>d</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>da</td><td>thing</td><td>substance</td></tr></table>

<p>Or, we can attach “ta” as an augment to “isi”.</p>

<p>The word “si” has <a href="philo_number.html" class="no-underline"><u>special rules</u></a> for how it's augmented, and it's not the only word that has special rules.

<p>Sometimes we want to use a whole compound as an augment, but this runs into trouble if we try to apply each seed in isolation.

<p>We’ve spent a lot of time with the word “ma” which when used as a verb roughly means “to communicate”. Thus “ipa la ma” means “the person talks”. But sentences don't just need subjects to do the action, they also sometimes need objects to be acted on. The phrase particle “lu” marks the direct object in a sentence.</p>

<p>If we want to say the previous sentence with the noun first, we can use the phrase particle “lua”. In other words, “lua” is a verb-phrase particle just like “la”, except it indicates that the previous phrase is an object.</p>

<p>It's often useful to talk about relations between actions in the abstract. For example, “the speaker is good” is a different sentence from “speaking is good”. To talk about an abstract action this we attach “-sh” as a suffix to “li” or “lu”.

<p>One thing you may notice from these examples is that the “i-”/“u-” orientation prefix doesn't need to be provided unless the clause has non-abstract nouns. We're capable of saying “ivu lish ma”, but the meaning is exactly the same as “vu lish ma”, so we're allowed to drop the leading “i-”. To set the orientation deeper into an expression, we put “i” or “u” after the letter “r”. When we have both an “-r” suffix and a “-sh” suffix, we put “-r” first. Thus “lirish” is “lish” that sets the orientation to left-mode. Just remember that orientation persists as we enter/leave sub-clauses, so all of this is just syntax sugar to let us specify the orientation closer to where it's being used.</p>
<p>In the examples above, sub-clauses are given at the end of the parent clause because once we're inside the sub-clause we don't have a way to say more more about the parent. To get around this restriction and escape back to the outer-scope, we can use the word “lash”, which ends the current clause.</p>

<h2 id='Prepositions'>Prepositions</h2>
<p>When we want to give additional context to a sentence, we can use sub-clauses as introduced in the previous sections. For instance if we want to say “a person speaks inside the container” we can say “(a person speaks) is inside the container”. But sometimes, especially when quickly composing a sentence during conversation, it's useful to be able to say “a person speaks... inside the container”, where we see the first part of the sentence as the primary content, and the note about being inside the container as additional info that's tacked on as an afterthought.</p>
<p>The word “lai” is the fastest and most common way of adding context. It can be seen as a preposition marker, or just a shorthand for the structures of the previous section that doesn't require forethought. A basic rule is that (while left-oriented) “X lai Y Z” = “lush X lash la Y li Z”, where X is all the rest of the sentence, Y is <em>a single seed word</em>, and Z is a phrase. This reduces the number of words needed to express a preposition by 75%!</p>

<p>The word “lai” works a little differently when in right-mode. When we're right-oriented “X lai Y Z” = “lish X lash la Y lu Z”. In other words it flips the relationship of the preposition. An easy mnemonic for how “lai” interacts with orientation is that (as we saw with “laibai bai”) it's redundant if Z is the same (seed word) as Y.</p>

<p>It’s vital to remember that the preposition, as a word, stops after a single syllable following the “lai”. Multi-syllable compounds can’t be used as prepositions without using <a href="spec.html" class="no-underline"><u>more complex grammatical structures</u></a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want to not just talk about the direct object of an action, but also indirect objects that are related to some action. For instance, in English we can say “he gave the animal a toy” and we understand “a toy” as the thing that was given.</p>
<p>Sumibli has no indirect objects, instead relying entirely on prepositions/subclauses. Just as we can say “he gave a toy <strong>to</strong> the animal” to communicate the same idea in English, we can use prepositions whenever additional context is needed in Sumibli.</p>

<h2 id='Possession'>Possession</h2>
<p>We've already talked about using words as adjectives using the word “shu”. The way “shu” works is essentially to find the overlap of two sets of things. For example, “igi shu kai” is talking about the intersection of the set of animals and the set of fast things.</p>
<p>But sometimes we want to talk about something that is associated with something else. We don't want “the thing that is an animal and is also a person”, but rather “the person's animal”. To do this, we use the word “sha”.</p>

<p>Note that this association is vague and asymmetric. It's not necessarily innate, social, legal, or exclusive.</p>
<p>English speakers may have an easier time translating “sha” as “of”, in order to not get the relationship backwards.</p>

<p>The most basic sentence particle is “tshia” (“chia”), which marks that the next sentence is a declaration/statement.

<h2 id='ForeignWords'>Foreign Words</h2>
<p>Not every concept will easily fit into Sumibli. Some words will need to be borrowed from other languages and cultures. This can be done easily with the suffix “-th”. Whenever we want to say a foreign word, we add “-th” as a suffix to whatever we were just saying. For example, we can use a loanword as the verb in a sentence by attaching “-th” after “la”.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>LEx-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>th</span></del><span class='smaller'><span> evolve </span></span></td><td>ikai lath <em>evolve</em></td><td>animals <em>evolve</em></td></tr></table>
<p>If you want to use foreign text for the subject of a sentence, the “-th” suffix can be attached to an explicit “li” or simply to the leading “i-” or “u-”.</p>
<p>Foreign words don't have a left/right orientation.</p>
<p>Alas, because foreign text can have arbitrary sounds, there is no explicit marker for the end of foreign speech; it's up to the speaker to make it clear that they're speaking Sumibli again. When writing, it's customary to include spaces around foreign words to distinguish them.</p>

<p>Things can also be given Sumibli names. A Sumibli name is just a standard word (seed or compound) that's preceded by the word “tha”. Remember to pronounce these words with a voiced “th” like the English word “<strong>th</strong>e”.</p>
<p>Much like foreign words, Sumibli names don't have an orientation. One way to think about this is that all Sumibli names are like verbs. Thus “tha sumibli” is not literally “Taxonomy” or “Taxon”, but more like “That-Which-Arranges-Classes-Into-A-Taxonomy”.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>XE-</u><del><span>th</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>SO-</u><del><span>s</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>MY-</u><del><span>m</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>Bli-</u><del><span>b</span><span>li</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>VO-</u><del><span>v</span><span>u</span><span></span></del></td><td>tha sumibli la vu</td><td>Sumibli is good</td></tr></table>
<p>Nicknames are common in Sumibli. This means it's fine to use “tha” liberally whenever things are clear. In many cases, this means it is right to use “tha” as the definite article, like the word “the” in English.</p>
<div class='return-to-top'><a href='#Top'>🔝</a></div>
<h2 id='Pronouns'>Pronouns</h2>
<p>Pronouns in Sumibli are based on representing something by “th”, followed by any vowel or diphthong besides “a”, followed by a consonant (including a silent “h”). There are no hard-and-fast rules for which pronoun to use for a given thing, but there are patterns depending on what's being described. Much like proper nouns, pronouns don't have an orientation and mean the same thing in left and right mode.</p>
<p>Pronouns for foreign names/words involve taking the first sounds from the name/word in question and trying to fit them into the pattern. For example, if we’re talking about “Mitch”, instead of saying “ith Mitch” we could use the pronoun “thim”. We choose “i” as the vowel because the vowel sound in “Mitch” is kinda close to “i”, and “m” as the consonant because it's the first sound in “Mitch”. Ultimately it's just a judgement call how a given set of sounds best map to the pronoun options. Sometimes it's useful to distinguish between two people with similar names by interpreting the sounds differently.</p>
<table><tr><td>Idaho</td><td>thaid</td></tr><tr><td>Wendy</td><td>thuan</td></tr><tr><td>Hayley</td><td>thaih<br/>(or maybe “thail”)</td></tr><tr><td>Max</td><td>thuam<br/>(or maybe “thum”)</td></tr></table>
<p>When using a pronoun to refer to a normal Sumibli noun, it's typical to use “i” or “u” sounds depending on the orientation of the noun, and use the first consonant in the noun phrase. Thus if we want a pronoun for taxonomy, we could use “this” (short for “isumibli”). Sometimes the first vowel is pushed in to make a dipthong like “thius”.</p>
<table><tr><td>pronghorn</td><td>ikaigi</td><td>thik</td></tr><tr><td>prowling</td><td>ukaingla</td><td>thuk</td></tr></table>
<p>To use a pronoun as a stand-in for a Sumibli name, we usually take the first vowel(s), and follow it by the consonant immediately after that vowel. For example “Sumibli” would be shortened to “thum”. If a Sumibli name is very short, such that no secondary consonant appears, we typically choose the first consonant.</p>
<table><tr><td>Pavu</td><td>thav</td></tr><tr><td>Pai</td><td>thaip</td></tr></table>
<p>To help associate pronouns with their subjects, sometimes a writer or speaker will add a pronoun after a name or compound using “halth [pronoun] tsh” to indicate that it's the shortened form. See <a href="spec.html" class="no-underline"><u>the full spec</u></a> for details on “halth”.</p>

<h2 id='LettersandAcronyms'>Letters and Acronyms</h2>
<p>It might be a good moment to introduce the way we talk about letters in Sumibli. It's just with pronouns! The consonants start with “thip” and alternate back and forth between “i” and “u”, all the way up to “thil” for “l”.</p>

<p>The vowels are then represented by diphthongs (with a silent “h” after).</p>

<p>Acronyms in Sumibli are just chains of pronouns. One can do a simple letter-by-letter acronym (“FBI” -> “thif thub thui”) or, more typically, an acronym that captures relevant sounds from each word (“Federal Bureau of Investigation” -> “thiaf thiub thin”). Because the space of pronouns is so large, it's rare to use acronyms in Sumibli.</p>

<h2 id='Quotes'>Quotes</h2>
<p>Much like we can import foreign words into Sumibli sentences, we can quote others by using the “-th” suffix before Sumibli text. To note that you're ending the quote, simply say “tsh” at the end of the quote. It is conventional to explicitly end quotes, even if that's the quote is the last thing you say.</p>

<h2 id='Attitudinals'>Attitudinals</h2>
<p>Sumibli lets us talk about the emotions of people (including the speaker) by using verbs/adjectives/etc. But there's also a shorthand that gives speakers the power to annotate their speech with emotional interjections. These interjections are a bit like emoji/emoticons, and are called “<em>attitudinals</em>”. Attitudinals all start with the letter “h” and are about the last word that was mentioned. Unlike standard words, attitudinals aren't making claims about the world, but are purely an expression of emotion, like “yay!”or “boo!”. Attitudinals have the same meaning in left/right mode.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>hi<br/>(“hee”)</td><td>yay!</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Ai-</u><del><span>h</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del></td><td>hai</td><td>ah!</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>E-</u><del><span>h</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>ha</td><td>ahh (calm/unmoved)</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>O-</u><del><span>h</span><span>u</span><span></span></del></td><td>hu</td><td>boo!</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del><u>E-</u><del><span>h</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LE-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>VO-</u><del><span>v</span><span>u</span><span></span></del></td><td>ikai ha la hi vu</td><td>animals😐<br/>are good😀</td></tr><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>ME-</u><del><span>m</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>E-</u><del><span>h</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>LO-</u><del><span>l</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><br/><u>XE-</u><del><span>th</span><span>a</span><span></span></del><u>SO-</u><del><span>s</span><span>u</span><span></span></del><u>MY-</u><del><span>m</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>Bli-</u><del><span>b</span><span>li</span><span></span></del></td><td>ma ha lu hi<br/>tha sumibli</td><td>there's talk<br/>about Sumibli<br/>(😐 about talk<br/>😀 about Sumibli)</td></tr></table>
<p>When an attitudinal shows up after a phrase particle like “la”, it’s about the entire phrase. Put an attitudinal immediately after the sentence marker (or as the first thing you say after “i-” or “u-”) to express the emotion about the entire sentence.</p>
<table><tr><td class='sumibli'><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>Y-</u><del><span>h</span><span>i</span><span></span></del><u>KAi-</u><del><span>k</span><span>ai</span><span></span></del></td><td>ihikai</td><td>There are animals! 😀</td></tr></table>
<p>Attitudinals can't be augmented in the normal way, but they can have suffixes. Attitudinal suffixes always have a pair of consonants, so that it's clear that the attitudinal continues. For example, “haigni” means “grrr! 😠”. In contrast, if the syllable after an attitudinal doesn't have a consonant cluster, this signifies the end of the attitudinal. So “haini” is two words (“hai ni”) and means something like “stop❗”.</p>
<p>Use “hau” to express confusion/curiosity. If used in the opening sentence of an expression, this implies the sentence is a question, unless it's explicitly marked otherwise.</p>

<p>That's it for basics! Congratulations!</p>
<p>There's more to learn, of course. The <a href="spec.html" class="no-underline"><u>full specification</u></a> has all the gory details of the grammar. There's vocabulary to internalize that can be easily browsed in the <a href="dict.html" class="no-underline"><u>dictionary tree explorer</u></a> or by reading <a href="works.html" class="no-underline"><u>previously translated works</u></a> and looking up words as you go. If you want to practice by yourself, there are more <a href="practice.html" class="no-underline"><u>online exercises</u></a> to try. And if you're interested in more theory there's a bunch of juicy <a href="philo.html" class="no-underline"><u>philosophy</u></a> waiting to be wrestled with. But you should consider yourself to know enough about Sumibli to start trying to <a href="community.html" class="no-underline"><u>converse with others in the community</u></a>.</p>
