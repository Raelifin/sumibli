I <strong>like</strong> Lojban, but I do so despite its flaws. Part of why I like it, is that it's relatively old. Lojban is grammatically very similar to Loglan, which got started in 1955! It's wonderfully ambitious compared to Esperanto, and clearly has a utopian aesthetic. Unfortunately, most of the mistakes that were present in the fifties were never ironed out, and new ones were added with time.</p>
<p>The big issue with Lojban is that it's a “kitchen sink” language. Despite trying to reflect “logic”, it fails to embody the property of formal systems like peano arithmetic of being fundamentally <strong>simple</strong>. There are few organizing principles at work for Lojban, and thus there's just a lot of things to learn, most of which could have been represented in a more standard way.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the grammatical class of VIhA, which I chose at random from the giant word cloud on the homepage of <a href="https://vlasisku.lojban.org/">la vlasisku</a>. VIhA words like “vi'a” are used to talk about intervals of space. Thus instead of being forced to say “The child walks on the ice”, one can say with an added “vi'a” that “The child walks on a 2-dimensional area of the ice”. <a href="http://lojban.github.io/cll/10/7/index.html">The CLL warns</a>: “Space intervals can contain either VEhA or VIhA or both, but if both, VEhA must come first”.</p>
<p>What the hell? I first encountered Lojban over ten years ago and I've never internalized that VIhA class words exist, much less that they have to come after VEhA words! Why not just have a more standard word for 2D area like... <a href="https://vlasisku.lojban.org/relca'u">relca'u</a> and say that a child walks on an icy relca'u?! Almost the whole language feels like this, where instead of having an aesthetic of clean elegance, the Lojban Group decided to wedge a gazillion different grammatical forms together out of some perverse desire for completeness or to compete with natural languages on their own turf.</p>
<p>Even the core structures feel over-engineered. Take the grammatical class LE, which is one of the very first classes that a speaker will learn and which everyone must use to speak the language. Here are the words in the class:</p>
<ul><li>le: the one described as ...</li><li>le'e: the stereotype of those described as ...</li><li>le'i: the set of those described as ...</li><li>lei: the mass of individuals described as ...</li><li>lo: the one, which is ...</li><li>lo'e: the typical one who really is ...</li><li>lo'i: the set of those that really are ...</li><li>loi: the mass of individuals that is ...</li></ul>
<p>I appreciate the observation that sometimes a speaker wants to talk about a mass of birds, vs a set of birds, vs a non-mass of specific birds. I find it odd that we need to bake that distinction into the LE grammar as opposed to simply using “gunma”, “girzu”, “bende”, “su'o re”, et cetera, et cetera. But fine, whatever. What's up with “le'e” and “lo'e”? Is this really a distinction that belongs on the LE level? Why have typicality and not also something like sometimes-but-not-often? But okay, let's say that I buy that we want to talk about typical cases using special words. What is even up with the distinction between “le” and “lo”??</p>
<p>The standard answer is that “le” is non-verdical, while “lo” is verdical. Verdicality, for those who don't know, is a property of statements (or, in logic, unary predicates) that says they assert of the truth of something. It seems bizarre to me to attach a conception of truth to the <em>phrase</em>, rather than the sentence. Lojban encourages me to distinguish “le cipni” from “lo cipni” – the latter describes birds while the former describes things that are described as birds. What. Just think about that for a moment. I need a whole class of words to talk about things that seem like birds, but aren't <em>truly</em> birds. How often, in your daily life do you expect to want to make this distinction? Is this really worth burning the incredibly precious space of one and two syllable words? To make things worse, “le” isn't even anti-verdical (like if it meant “things that are misakenly described as...”)! Describing a bird as “le cipni” is totally fine, and people do it all the time! What should I be doing differently in my mind when I read “le cipni” vs “lo cipni”?</p>
<p>The list of unnecessary grammatical rules and forms goes on and on to the point where one might suspect that Lojban was genuinely trying to imitate natural language. Sometimes it's even worse than natural language, though! Consider the place-structure of semantic words:</p>
<ul><li>cange: x1 is a farm/ranch at x2, farmed by x3, raising/producing x4</li><li>purdi: x1 is a garden/tended/cultivated field of family/community/farmer x2 growing plants/crop x3</li></ul>
<p>Here we have two words that are very closely related. Three of the operands of the words are basically the same, but “cange” has an additional operand (x2) that offsets the others compared to “purdi”. When I come across one of these two words, I need to ask myself “is this the word that has the farmer as x3 or the crop as x3?”. In practice, the complexity of the definitions of words in Lojban is so high that I don't even bother learning the place structure of words besides the most common ones, and instead rely on a combination of guessing and looking things up when needed. Eugh.</p>
<p>Speaking of things that Lojban does worse than natural language, I'll take this moment to complain about the strangeness of the Lojban gismu. If you're trying to build an international auxlang, it makes sense to have words that most people across the world know be in the language approximately as-they-are. For instance, here is the word for “coffee” in various languages:</p>
<ul><li>kāfēi (Mandarin)</li><li>café (Spanish)</li><li>kofe (Russian)</li><li>kofee (Hindi)</li><li>qahwa (Arabic)</li><li>kafo (Esperanto)</li></ul>
<p>The Lojban word for coffee is “ckafi”, which seems fine. We're forced to add another consonant to make it match the CCVCV structure of gismu, but that can be forgiven. But now consider the word for something less universal, like “dog”:</p>
<ul><li>gǒu (Mandarin)</li><li>perro (Spanish)</li><li>sobaka (Russian)</li><li>kutta (Hindi)</li><li>kalb (Arabic)</li><li>hundo (Esperanto)</li></ul>
<p>There simply is no word that will be accessible to all speakers. Lojban chose the amusing, but ultimately flawed method of blending the sounds of the words from various languages using an algorithm and came up with “gerku”, which I claim is guessable by nobody. It's essentially just a random mash of sounds, which I suppose is fine... I mean, it's not like it's hard to pronounce or anything...</p>
<p>Oh wait. In their effort to have a standard form of words and to generate them by algorithmic blending, some truly monstrous gismu came out. Which words are hardest will depend on what your native language is. English speakers will struggle with words like “mlatu” (cat), “jmive” (living), “xabju” (dwelling), or “pinxe” (drink). And that's not even getting into compound words like “xalpixydu'e” (drunkard).</p>
<p>And now, while we're on the subject of how hard Lojban is to pronounce, let's talk about the letters “x”, “y”, and “'” (and “r”, frankly, but I'm an American so I'll ignore it). In a language designed to be accessible across the world, who thought it was a good idea to have the voiceless velar fricative [x]? One would think that you'd want the intersection of sounds that were easily made by your desired speakers, rather than the union! (That's a joke, but seriously: x is a bad sound for a language that wants to have wide appeal.) The “y” schwa [ə] sound is also a bad choice, in my opinion, as it's quite hard for most speakers to distinguish from “a” and “e”, either in listening or speaking. The five-vowel system is good, but then Lojban decided to muck it up because it needed a way to make compound words work in cases where the resulting compound would be unpronounceable. (And very much as a nitpick: The use of the apostrophe for the “h” sound is silly. Just because Loglan used “h” for “x” doesn't mean it makes sense to use apostrophes as letters.)</p>
<p>One of my biggest complaints with Lojban is about how compound words (lujvo) are formed. Many core-words (gismu) have a short form (rafsi) that can be used in place of the full word when making a compound. Coffee-dog doesn't have to be “ckafigerku”, it can just be “kafge'u” or maybe “kafyge'u”... I often can't tell when I'm supposed to insert a schwa. This is good, because four syllables (cka-fi-ger-ku) is a lot for a two-concept compound. Oh wait. ka-fy-ge-'u. Oops. The short form is perhaps just as long. Well, at least it makes it shorter in some cases!</p>
<p>But by having rafsi that are different from the gismu, suddenly I have a whole bunch more to memorize. What's the rafsi of “gerku”? It's “ge'u” and “ger”! Ah, but don't end a word with “ger”! That's not allowed! What's the rafsi for “zunle” (left)? It's “zul”. What's the rafsi for “pritu” (right)? There is none. Ugh! It's edge-case after edge-case with no pattern or logic or governing principle! And don't get me started on the random semantics of how place-structures change when words are combined! 😠</p>

<h2 id='Nitpicks'>Nitpicks</h2>
<p>One might think that the above gripes were somewhat nit-picky. But I think they all fit together into a gestalt of a language that is confused and designed-by-committee and lacks the very thing that it aspires towards: logic. With that dealbreaker out of the way, let's talk about some smaller issues.</p>
<p>The rules for names are bad. Intuitively I'd have guessed that gismu don't have any proper nouns, but nope! The words “kadno” (Canadian) or “merko” (US American) or “mexno” (Mexican). I guess they decided to turn all the countries into gismu? Nope! There's no gismu for Switzerland, Poland, Vietnam, South Africa, Peru, or Cuba.</p>
<p>And Lojban even has rules for naming foreign things, albeit weird rules that often require contorting the base word into a semi-unrecognizable shape. For example, “Acer” is Lojbanized as “xaceru”.</p>
<p>I'm also not a fan of the way Lojban words are ordered in a compound. The concept of “big boat” mirrors the English, becoming “barda bloti”. In languages that have prefix modifiers, I find myself hearing “big”, and then wondering “big what”, then only when I hear “boat” do I understand that we're talking about ships. I think a more logical ordering would be “bloti barda”, where I can immediately know that we're talking about a boat, and then once I hear “barda” I can modify the imagined boat to be large.</p>
<p>This nit-pick can be taken to extremes, and used to criticize how Lojban does numbers. Rather than hold Lojban to the standard of having <a href="philo_number.html" class='no-underline'><u>the correct number system</u></a>, however, I'll end with a simple nit-pick about the Lojban digits:</p>
<ul><li>0 - no</li><li>1 - pa</li><li>2 - re</li><li>3 - ci</li><li>4 - vo</li><li>5 - mu</li><li>6 - xa</li><li>7 - ze</li><li>8 - bi</li><li>9 - so</li></ul>
<p>There's a nice pattern here! We have an ordering to the five vowels, and that ordering repeats as we go past 5. But, uh... What's up with “no”? Shouldn't it be “nu”, to complete the pattern? Or maybe having “no” mean 0 is cute enough to warrant changing the other words to match. But something is clearly off.</p>
