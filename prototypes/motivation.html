<p>Sumibli is designed around a core set of principles. If you ever wonder why an aspect of Sumibli
is the way it is, the story should ultimately trace back to one of the principles listed here.
Another way of framing this list is as a description of what virtues Sumibli aspires to have.</p>
<p>Let's dive in!</p>
<h2>Utility</h2>
<p>More than anything else, Sumibli strives to be an effective tool for communication.
Expressing ideas, complex or simple, should be easy and efficient for fluent speakers.
Expressions should be clear by default, with no need to avoid linguistic traps or edge-cases.
The language should allow for speakers to emphasize whatever is important to them, and to
avoid forcing specificity on unimportant things.</p>
<h2>Purity</h2>
<p>Sumibli is designed to be a language of first-principles, almost entirely rebuilt
without reference to the languages, cultures, and customs of Old Earth. The design of words
and grammar should stand on its own philosophy, rather than reference natural etymologies
and legacy systems. Sumibli strives to lead the way into a glorious future, not be held back
by naive or unconscious choices made by our ancestors.</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>The language should be designed around principles of minimalism and regularity. It should be
so simple that an average human can learn the basics in a single sitting and no aspect should be
able to be simplified further without significant cost to the language's comprehensibility and
general utility. Everything should follow a clean story and a regular pattern.</p>
<h2>Typability</h2>
<p>Sumibli is designed to be composed using a keyboard. Digital interfaces are ideal for linguistic
expression, and keyboards are a surprisingly good means of inputting digital data. As such,
written sumibli should be easy to read (but not necessarily easy to scribe with a pen). There should
be <a href="">a keyboard that allows Sumibli to by written at the speed of thought</a>.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with English</h2>
<p>Without sacrificing any of the above, the language should be easy to learn and speak by
humans who are fluent in English in the year 2022. English words should be easy to transcode
into the Sumibli alphabet without too much loss, and none of the Sumibli sounds should be
outside of the repetoir of the average English speaker. Some consideration is made for other
common languages, but English is the focus because that's what Max Harms speaks.</p>
