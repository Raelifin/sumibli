<h2>The Sumibli Alphabet</h2>
<p>Sumibli is written using 20 letters that each have a "conceptual atmosphere".
The letter "g", for instance, is associated with the concepts of action, motion, fire, and the number 5 (among other things).
When letters are combined into a word, the meaning and usage of that word can be guessed by the letters that compose it.
In this way, the alphabet for Sumibli forms a kind of loose taxonomy of concepts, and it's very helpful to
start with the basics of this taxonomy.</p>
<p>By the way, "g" isn't really a letter in the Sumibli alphabet. Rather,
<span class="sumibli"><u>5-</u><del><span></span><span>g</span><span></span></del></span>
is a letter, and since it sounds like the first sound in "go" we represent it in the latin alphabet as "g".
To help remember the latin alphabet versions of the Sumibli letters, we provide an English word that is associated
with the letter's conceptual atmosphere and that features the same sound as the letter.</p>

<h2>Alphabet Patterns</h2>
<p>Twenty letters is a lot to take in, especially when each comes attached to a meaning.
It helps if we break up the alphabet into groups of letters based on some simple patterns.</p>
<p>The first six letters form a group of <em>plosives</em> that all have a similar sound.
Try sounding out "pa ba ta da ka ga" to yourself.
Each plosive involves briefly stopping the air coming out of your lungs.
They occur in order, starting from the lips and moving towards the back of the mouth,
with every other sound (b, d, g) being "voiced" by action in the throat.
(This pattern of voiced consonants occuring right after their unvoiced counterparts ("tada") is a general pattern across the alphabet.)</p>
<p>The number six is important in Sumibli, and there are six plosives.
These are the letters most commonly associated with a number,
and their symbols in the Sumibli script are drawn with a number of strokes equal to their order in the alphabet.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the next six consonants: n, m, r, l, s, and z. Together with the plosives, these form the
<em>standard consonants</em>, which are all drawn with characters that are about three times as wide as they are tall.
The standard consonants appear in order of increasing abstraction, and we can tell a story with them of a person who grows up,
exploring more complex and distant subjects as they age:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong class="monospace">p</strong> - the new <strong>p</strong>erson can <strong>p</strong>ercieve and <strong>p</strong>onder</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">b</strong> - and soon they know the <strong>b</strong>ounds of their <strong>b</strong>ody and <strong>b</strong>eing</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">t</strong> - where <strong>t</strong>his and <strong>t</strong>ha<strong>t</strong> are a<strong>t</strong> in space and <strong>t</strong>ime</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">d</strong> - and how <strong>d</strong>evices and <strong>d</strong>irt are <strong>d</strong>istinct</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">k</strong> - in the world they meet <strong>c</strong>reatures like <strong>k</strong>angaroos and <strong>k</strong>oalas</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">g</strong> - they play <strong>g</strong>ames of <strong>g</strong>oing places and <strong>g</strong>etting <strong>g</strong>oals</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">n</strong> - but e<strong>n</strong>counter <strong>n</strong>egative people who do <strong>n</strong>ot like the games</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">m</strong> - and so <strong>m</strong>yths are <strong>m</strong>anufactured to <strong>m</strong>ake</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">r</strong> - <strong>r</strong>elational ha<strong>r</strong>mony eme<strong>r</strong>ge through t<strong>r</strong>ading <strong>r</strong>esources</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">l</strong> - and a<strong>ll</strong>owing fee<strong>l</strong>ings of <strong>l</strong>asting <strong>l</strong>ove and be<strong>l</strong>onging</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">s</strong> - to give <strong>s</strong>pace for <strong>s</strong>tudying the <strong>s</strong>ecrets of <strong>s</strong>ymbols</li>
  <li><strong class="monospace">z</strong> - like <strong>z</strong>ero and <strong>z</strong>ed and the abstract <strong>z</strong>en of endings</li>
</ul>
<p>The final five consonants in the alphabet (f, v, sh, th, and h) are called <em>structural constants</em>
because their meanings are mostly grammatical. They provide the words that give sentences their structure
and make things comprehensible, without providing content in themselves. Each will be introduced later on.
These letters can be larger than the standard consonants and behave differently in Sumibli script.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the three <em>vowels</em>: i, a, and u. Sumibli doesn't put a lot of emphasis on vowel sounds,
and they don't have much meaning. But the general story is that they're lined up from the tightest ("i") to the
loosest ("u") and can similarly be seen as going from near to far, with "a" being in the middle.</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Pronunciation Tips for Consonants</h2>
<p>Sumibli consonants mostly sound as you'd expect from seeing the latin equivalent.
But we should briefly mention some things about the last three consonants: sh, th, and h.</p>
<p>The letter "sh" (aka "j") is usually pronounced like the first sound in "<strong>sh</strong>oe"
but can also be pronounced like the first sound in "<strong>g</strong>enre" or the last sound in "mira<strong>ge</strong>".
In other words, Sumibli doesn't distinguish the voiced and unvoiced sounds.</p>
<p>The letter "th" (aka "x") also can be either voiced or unvoiced, sounding either like "<strong>th</strong>is" or like "wi<strong>th</strong>".
The voiced version is correct at the start of words, while the unvoiced is correct at the end of words,
exactly like in the example of "<strong>th</strong>is" vs "wi<strong>th</strong>".</p>
<p>The letter "h" can be silent as long as it's clear which words are which,
like in the word "<span class="fade">h</span>our"
or when a person with a French accent says the word "<span class="fade">h</span>appy".</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Diphthongs</h2>
<p>When two different Sumibli vowels appear next to each other, they combine into a diphthong.
You can <a href="">read the full specification</a> if you want all the details, but here's the basic version:</p>
<table>
  <thead class="smaller">
    <tr><th>Sumibli Diphthong</th><th>Latin Equivalent</th><th>Pronunciation Guide</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>IA-</u><del><span></span><span>ia</span><span></span></del></td><td>ia</td><td><strong>yaw</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>IU-</u><del><span></span><span>iu</span><span></span></del></td><td>iu</td><td><strong>you</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>AI-</u><del><span></span><span>ai</span><span></span></del></td><td>ai</td><td><strong>eye</strong></td></tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Sumibli Atoms</h2>
<p>Sumibli words are very small - so small, in fact, that we call them "atoms".
This is to suggest a contrast with compound-words that are formed from combining atoms together.
A Sumibli atom always starts with a consonant and has exactly one vowel or one diphthong.
When we write an atom in Sumibli script, we stack the letters on top of one another to form a glyph.
(For the structural consonants other than "h" we sandwich the vowel inside the consonant.)</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>PA-</u><del><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td><td>pa<br/>("pah")</td><td>to think</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-</u><del><span>k</span><span>i</span><span>k</span></del></td><td>kik<br/>("keek")</td><td>a fish</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-</u><del><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>a</span></del></td><td>pra<br/>("prah")</td><td>a person</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>NUAg-</u><del><span>n</span><span>ua</span><span>g</span></del></td><td>nuag<br/>("nwag")</td><td>to sleep</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>VI-</u><del><span>v</span><span>i</span><span></span></del></td><td>vi<br/>("vi")</td><td>{verb}</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Atoms that start with a structural consonant (f, v, sh, th, or h) are <em>structural atoms</em>.
Those that start with a standard consonant (p, b, t, d, k, g, n, m, r, l, s, or z) are <em>standard atoms</em>.</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Simple Sentences</h2>
<p>All standard atoms can be sentences by themselves.
For instance, the sentence "kik" means "there is a fish" or "there are fish".
Sumibli doesn't force the speaker to give a quantity, so it's vague by default.
Tense is also not required, so "kik" can also mean "there were fish" or "there will be fish".</p>
<p>When a noun-like word like "kik" is used like this we think of it being a statement about existence ("a fish exists").
Verb-like words like "nuag" (sleep) can also be thought of as being about existence sometimes.
The sentence "nuag" can be translated "someone is sleeping", "there is sleeping", or "a sleeper exists".</p>
<p>But what if we want to say "a fish was sleeping"?
For this we use the stucture atom "vi" to mark the verb of the sentence.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-NUAg-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi nuag</td><td>a fish was sleeping</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Sentence Order</h2>
<p>Sumibli sentences are very flexible.
By default the subject comes first, followed by "vi" and then the verb.
(When there's no verb, the sentence is about existence/being.)
But we can also have the verb come first, followed by "via" and then the subject.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-VI-PA-</u>
    <del><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>a</span><span>v</span><span>i</span><span></span><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pra vi pa</td><td>the person is thinking</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>PA-VIA-P8a-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pa via pra</td><td>the person is thinking</td></tr>
</table>
<p>We can rearrange the parts of the sentence to emphasize different things, or simply to be poetic.
A part of a sentence preceded by an atom that starts with "v" is a <em>phrase</em> (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc).
We can even explicitly mark the first phrase in the sentence, even though we usually don't.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>VIA-P8a-VI-PA-</u>
    <del><span>v</span><span>ia</span><span></span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>a</span><span>v</span><span>i</span><span></span><span>p</span><span>a</span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>via pra vi pa</td><td>the person is thinking</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
<p>Here are a few more words to work with:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>BUd-</u><del><span>b</span><span>u</span><span>d</span></del></td><td>bud<br/>("bood")</td><td>heavy</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>TAm-</u><del><span>t</span><span>a</span><span>m</span></del></td><td>tam</td><td>northern</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>LAl-</u><del><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>l</span></del></td><td>lal</td><td>good</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Just like with any standard atom, these can be used as verbs.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-BUd-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi bud</td><td>the fish is heavy</td></tr>
</table>
<p>And likewise, any standard atom can be used as a noun, including these.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>TAm-</u><del><span>t</span><span>a</span><span>m</span></del></td><td>tam</td><td>there is a northerner</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>TAm-VI-NUAg-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>tam vi nuag</td><td>the northerner is asleep</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>TAm-VI-P8a-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>tam vi pra</td><td>the northern one is a person</td></tr>
</table>
<p>To use words as adjectives - to modifying some noun without needing a full sentence to modify it - we use a new structure atom: "fu".
We put fu in a phrase between the noun and the adjective.
And in fact, any standard atom can be used as an adjective, not just the ones that are adjective-like!</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-FU-BUd-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik fu bud</td><td>there was a heavy fish</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-FU-LAl-VI-TAm-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik fu lal vi tam</td><td>the good fish<br/>are to the north</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-FU-PA-VI-LAl-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pra fu pa vi lal</td><td>a thinking person<br/>is a good one</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The word "fu" can also be used to modify actions (as adverb) just as easily as it can modify things (as an adjective).</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-VI-NUAg-FU-LAl-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pra vi nuag fu lal</td><td>the person<br/>sleeps correctly</td></tr>
</table>
<p>We usually think of "fu" as making one of the words an adjective/adverb,
but we can also think of it as talking about the intersection of two concepts.
A heavy fish is the insersection of fish and heavy things.
To sleep correctly is the intersection of being asleep and being correct.</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Compounds</h2>
<p>So far we've been considering phrases with a single atom, or ones broken up by "fu" into <em>sub-phrases</em> with one atom each.
But now let's consider what happens when two standard atoms come in contact with each other.
This structure is called a "compound" and is similar to compound words in English like "snow-man" or "air-plane".</p>
<p>A snowman is not really a man made of snow, and it's certainly not a snowy man.
Instead, compounds are new concepts that can have a distinct meaning in the dictionary.
For example, we use "kik fu bud" to say "dense fish", but this is a very different thing from "kik bud",
which we often just write as "kikbud" when using Latin text.
A kikbud is a benthic organism - a creature that lives in the water but mostly sinks rather than swims, like a lobster or a starfish.
Kikbud are fish in the sense that they are creatures that live in water (see <a href="">the philosophy of animals</a> for more),
and they're dense in the sense that they sink rather than float, but they're a more specific thing than just dense fish.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIb-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kib</td><td>organ</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>NIk-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>nik</td><td>to consume/eat/drink</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIb-NIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kibnik</td><td>mouth</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIb-FU-NIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kib fu nik</td><td>consuming organ<br/>(mouth, stomach, gut, etc)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Order matters when forming compounds. A snow-man is not the same as man-snow, and it's the same in Sumibli.
We treat the word on the left as the <em>root</em> and the word on the right as the <em>augment</em>.
The compound is always a variation on the root, hinted at (sometimes metaphorically) by the augment.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>NIk-KIb-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>nikkib</td><td>to consume/eat/drink<br/>using a body part</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Despite the danger of misusing a compound, Sumibli speakers are encouraged to default to using compounds instead of modifying with "fu".
What is a "kikpra"? It's not in the dictionary, but we can guess it means something like "sentient fish".
If I want to talk about fish people, "kikpra" serves my goal at least as well as "kik fu pra".</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🎮</a> <a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Large Compounds</h2>
<p>When we see a compound made with three standard atoms back-to-back,
we group atoms on the left, so that the new compound is modified by the atom on the right.</p>

<h2>Direct Objects</h2>
<p>A couple sections back we introduced the word "nik" which means roughly "to eat", so we can say "kik vi nik" for "the fish eats".
But sentences don't just need subjects to do the action, they also sometimes need objects to be acted on.
We use the word "va" to mark the direct object in a sentence, just like we use "via" to mark the subject or "vi" for the verb.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-NIk-VA-P8a</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi nik va pra</td><td>a fish ate the person</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-VI-NIk-VA-KIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pra vi nik va kik</td><td>people eat fish</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If "va" is used in a sentence without an explicitly marked verb, we interpret the first part of the sentence as a verb.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>NIk-VA-KIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>nik va kik</td><td>fish are eaten</td></tr>
</table>
<p>All Sumibli verbs (and thus all standard atoms and compounds) have room for a direct object.
In the case of "nik" it's pretty clear that the direct object is what's being eaten,
but can you guess what the direct object of "pra" (person) is?</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>P8a-VI-P8a-VA-KIk</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>pra vi pra va kik</td><td>the person<br/>has the personality<br/>of a fish</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are patterns that help us guess what the relationship is between the subject and the object,
but in many cases you'll just need to look up the word in the dictionary to be sure.</p>

You're about half-way done, but things will get harder and build on previous material.
Sumibli is a very simple language, but it still takes time to internalize new things.</p>

<h2>Actions as Nouns</h2>
<p>It's often useful to talk about relations between actions.
For example, "the eater is good" is different from "eating is good".
To do this we can use a new structure atom: "vai".
The atom "vai" only appears at the start of a sentence or immediately after either "via" or "va".
When it appears at the start of the sentence we pretend that there's a "via" before it.
In other words, we see "vai" as a modifier to the subject or object of a sentence.
Instead of a normal noun phrase, something modified by "vai" becomes a subclause that works much like a full sentence in itself.
These subclauses can even be nested!</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>LAl-VIA-NIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>

</table>
<p>All these examples of sub-clauses are given at the end of the parent clause because we can't say anything more
about the parent once we're inside the subclause. If we want to get around this restriction and escape back to the outer-scope,
we can use the atom "viu".</p>

<h2>Prepositions</h2>
<p>When we want to give additional context to a sentence, we can use subclauses as introduced in the previous section.
For instance if we want to say "a fish thinks inside" we can say "(a fish thinks) is inside".
But sometimes, especially when quickly composing a sentence during conversation, it's useful to be able to say
"a fish thinks... inside", where we see the first part of the sentence as the primary content,
and the note about being inside as less-important, additional info.</p>
<p>The atom "vu" is the fastest and most common way of additing context info.
It can be seen as a preposition marker, or just a shorthand for the structures of the previous section that doesn't require forethought.
The basic rule is that "X vu Y Z" = "viavai X viu vi Y va Z",
where X is the whole sentence before the "vu", Y is <em>a single atom</em>, and Z is a phrase.
This reduces the number of atoms needed to express a preposition by 80%!
Additionally, "vu" can't be nested; if you see another "vu" after the first it's assumed to be more additional info about the same action.</p>
<p>Let's look at some examples:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>T8i-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td><td>tri</td><td>inside</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-T8i-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi tri</td><td>a fish is inside</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-PA-VU-T8i-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi pa vutri</td><td>a fish thinks inside</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-PA-VU-T8i-NIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vi pa vutri nik<tri nik</td><td>a fish thinks<br/>inside the eater</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Because of the special role of the first atom after the "vu", when writing in latin script we customarily leave out the space.</p>

<h2>Indirect Objects</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to not just talk about the direct object of an action,
but also indirect objects that are related to some action.
For instance, in English we can say "he gave her a toy" and we understand "a toy" as the thing that was given.</p>
<p>Sumibli has no indirect objects, instead relying entirely on prepositions/subclauses.
Just as we can say "he gave a toy <strong>to</strong> her" to communicate the same idea in English,
we can use prepositions whenever additional context is needed in Sumibli.</p>

<h2>Possession</h2>
<p>We've already talked about using words as adjectives using the atom "fu".
The way "fu" works is essentially to find the overlap of two sets of things.
For example, "kik fu bud" is talking about the intersection of the set of fishes and the set of heavy things.</p>
<p>But sometimes we want to talk about something that is associated with something else.
We don't want "the thing that is a mouth and is also a person", but rather "the person's mouth".
To do this, we use the word "fa".</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>BUd-FA-KIk-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>

<h2>Statements, Requests, and Questions</h2>

<h2>Answering Questions</h2>
<p>Standard questions are yes/no by default.
To answer such a question you can say "za", which means "true", or "zan", which means "false".

The word "na" also works as a response that means "the opposite is true".</p>

<h2>Foreign Words</h2>
<p>Not every concept will easily fit into Sumibli. Some words will need to be borrowed from other languages and cultures.
This can be done easily with the letter "th".
Whenever we want to say a foreign word, we add "th" as a suffix to whatever we were just saying.
For example, we can use a loanword as the verb in a sentence by attaching "th" after "vi".</p>
<p>It's up to the writer whether foreign words are written in their native script, or translated into Sumibli script.
Regardless, the word should be pronounced according to how the natives say it, even if those sounds aren't supported by the Sumibli alphabet.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del>þ<span class="smaller"><span> swim</span></span></td>
    <td>kik vith <em>swim</em></td><td>fish <em>swim</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>KIk-VI-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del>þ <u>SUIm-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>kik vith <em>swim</em></td><td>fish <em>swim</em></td></tr>
</table>
<p>If you want to use foreign text for the subject of a sentence,
the "th" suffix can be attached either to an explicit "via" or to an explicit marker for the start of the sentence like "shi".</p>
<p>Because foreign text can have arbitrary sounds, there is no explicit marker for the end of foreign speech;
it's up to the speaker to make it clear that they're speaking Sumibli again.
When writing, it's customary to include spaces around foreign words to distinguish them.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>VIA-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del>þ<span class="smaller"><span> sushi</span> </span><u>VI-LAl-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>

    <td>shith <em>sushi</em> vi kik</td><td><em>sushi</em> is fish</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Remember that "th" when used in this way is always pronounced <em>un</em>voiced, like in "wi<strong>th</strong>".
When a "th" suffix is added to the end of a word with a trailing consonant,
it's permitted to inject a short "uh" sound before the "th" to aid in pronunciation.
This added sound is not a letter, and doesn't show up in written Sumibli.</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Names</h2>
<p>Foreign names work exactly the same way that other foreign words do.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>JAI-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del>þ<span class="smaller"><span> Max</span> </span><u>VI-P8a-LAl-</u><del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>shaith <em>Max</em> vi pralal</td><td>Is <em>Max</em> a hero?</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Things can also be given Sumibli names.
A Sumibli name is just an atom or compound that's preceded by the atom "thi".
Remember to pronounce it with a voiced "th" like the English word "<strong>th</strong>e".
When talking about something with a Sumibli name in another language, the "thi" is dropped.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>ÞI-SU-MI-B9i-VI-LAl-</u>

    <td>thi sumibli vi lal</td><td>Sumibli is good</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Nicknames are common in Sumibli.
In other words, it's fine to use "thi" liberally whenever things are clear.
In many cases, this means it is right to use "thi" as the definite article, like "the" in English.</p>
<div class="return-to-top"><a href="">🔝</a></div>

<h2>Me and You</h2>
<p>Most languages have pronouns for the speaker and the listener, like "me" and "you".
Sumibli instead opts to use the same words that one would use for any speaker/lisener and rely on context to keep things clear.</p>

<h2>Other Pronouns</h2>
<p>Pronouns in Sumibli are based on compressing a name (or long compound) down to one syllable.
The atom "tha" marks a pronoun, and the atom following it is the compressed version of the person/thing's name.
For instance, if we're talking about "Mitch Halley", instead of giving his full name each time, we could reference him as "tha mil".
We start by representing "Mitch Halley" as phonetically written Sumibli: "mitsh hali".
(See <a href="">the full spec</a> for details on transcribing foreign sounds.)
We take the first standard consonant and follow it by the first vowel/diphthong.
If the first consonant is standard and there's more than one consonant in the name, we also take the final <em>standard</em> consonant.</p>
<p>Note that "Mitch Halley" gets shortened to "mil" but "Mitch" gets shortened to "mit" (because "sh" is structural).
Sumibli's pronoun system doesn't specify whether to compress a person's full name just their first/last name.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>ÞA-MIl-VI-MIt-VA-ÞA-JAI-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>tha mil vi mit<br/>va tha shai</td><td>"Mil" will talk<br/>to "Shai"</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that Sumibli pronouns always put the first consonant in front of the first vowel, even when people's names start with a vowel.
This including glides/semivowels like "Y" and "W".</p>
<p><strong>A</strong><u>l</u>i<em>c</em>e is referenced with "tha <u>l</u><strong>a</strong><em>s</em>".</p>
<p><strong>We</strong><u>n</u>dy Pet<em>r</em>ov is referenced with "tha <u>n</u><strong>ua</strong><em>r</em>" (because "v" is not a structural).</p>

<h2>Letter Names</h2>
<p>While we're talking about letters, it might be a good moment to introduce the way we talk about letters in Sumibli.
The letters "thu" may be (and must be) suffixed by any consonant, even a non-standard one.
This forms the word for that consonant.
In written Sumibli we put the consonant in a glyph by itself following "thu", vertically centered.</p>

  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>ÞU-0-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>

<p>To talk about vowels, we use the atom "thui" and follow it with either "hi", "ha", or "hu".</p>

<h2>Attitudinals</h2>
<p>Sumibli lets us talk about the emotions of people (including the speaker) by using verbs/adjectives/etc.
But there's also a shorthand that gives speakers the power to annotate their speech with emotional interjections.
These interjections are a bit like emoji/emoticons, and are called "<em>attitudinals</em>".
Attitudinals all start with the letter "h" and are attached to the last thing that was mentioned.
Unlike standard words, attitudinals aren't making claims about the world, but are purely an expression of emotion, like "yay!" or "boo!".</p>

  <tr><td class="sumibli"><u>HI-</u>
    <del><span></span><span></span><span></span></del></td>
    <td>hi<br/>("hee")</td><td>yay!</td></tr>

</table>
<p>Put an attitudinal immediately after the sentence marker (or as the first thing you say)
to express the emotion about the entire sentence.</p>
<p>Use "hau" to express confusion/curiosity.
This implies the sentence is a question, unless otherwise marked as a belief/command.</p>

<p>That's it for basics! Congratulations!</p>
<p>There's more to learn, of course.
The <a href="" class="no-underline">📖<u> full specification</u></a> has all the gory details of the grammar.
There's vocabulary to internalize that can be easily browsed in the <a href="" class="no-underline">🌳<u> dictionary tree explorer</u></a>
or by reading <a href="" class="no-underline">💬<u> previously translated works</u></a> and looking up words as you go.
If you want to practice by yourself, there are more <a href="" class="no-underline">🎮<u> online exercises</u></a> to try.
And if you're interested in more theory there's a bunch of juicy <a href="" class="no-underline">🧠<u> philosophy</u></a> waiting to be wrestled with.
But you should consider yourself to know enough about Sumibli to start trying to <a href="" class="no-underline">🗣️<u> converse with others in the community</u></a>.</p>
